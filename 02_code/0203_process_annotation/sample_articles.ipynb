       " 'Ethnopharmacological relevance: Terminalia chebula Retz. (T.chebula) is an important medicinal plant in Tibetan medicine and Ayurveda. T.chebula is known as the \"King of Tibetan Medicine\", due to its widespread clinical pharmacological activity such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antidiabetic as well as anticancer in lots of in vivo and in vitro models. In this study, we use transgenic and/or RNAi Caenorhabditis elegans (C.elegans) model to simulation the AD pathological features induced by A beta, to detect the effect of TWE on improving A beta-induced toxicity and the corresponding molecular mechanism. Aim of study: The study aimed to tested the activities and its possible mechanism of T.chebula to against A beta 1-42 induced toxicity and A beta 1-42 aggregation. Materials and methods: Using transgenic C.elegans strain CL2006 and CL4176 as models respond to paralytic induced by A beta toxicity. The transcription factors DAF-16 and SKN-1 were analyzed used a fluorescence microscope in transgenic strains (DAF-16:GFP, SKN-1:GFP). The function of DAF-16 and SKN-1 was further investigated using loss-of-function strains by feeding RNA interference (RNAi) bacteria. To evaluate the aggregation level of A beta in the transgenic C.elegans, Thioflavin S (ThS) staining and WB visualized the levels of A beta monomers and oligomers. Results: TWE treatment can significantly improve the paralysis of transgenic C.elegans caused by A beta aggregation (up to 14%). The A beta aggregates in transgenic C.elegans are significantly inhibited under TWE exposure (up to 70%). TWE increases the nuclear localization of the key transcription factor DAF-16 and HSF-1, which in turn leads to the expression of downstream Hsp-16.2 protein and exerts its inhibitory effect on A beta aggregation. Meanwhile, paralysis improved has not observed in SKN-1 mutation and/or RNAi C.elegans. Conclusion: Our results indicate that TWE can protect C.elegans against the A beta 1-42-induced toxicity, inhibition A beta 142 aggregation and delaying A beta-induced paralysis. The neuroprotective effect of TWE involves the activation of DAF-16/HSF-1/Hsp-16.2 pathway.',\n",

A history of sepsis is also a risk factor for future development of dementia symptoms. Similar neuropathologic changes are associated with the cognitive decline of sepsis and Alzheimer?s disease (AD), including neuroinflammation, neuronal death, and synaptic loss. Amyloid plaque pathology is the earliest pathological hallmark of AD, appearing 10 to 20 years prior to cognitive decline, and is present in 30% of people over 65. As sepsis is also more common in older adults, we hypothesized that sepsis might exacerbate amyloid plaque deposition and plaque-related injury, promoting the progression of AD-related pathology. Methods: We evaluated whether the brain?s response to sepsis modulates AD-related neurodegenerative changes by driving amyloid deposition and neuroinflammation in mice. We induced polymicrobial sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in APP/PS1?21 mice, a model of AD-related ?-amyloidosis. We performed CLP or sham surgery at plaque onset (2 months of age) and examined pathology 2 months after CLP in surviving mice. Results: Sepsis significantly increased fibrillar amyloid plaque formation in the hippocampus of APP/PS1?21 mice. Sepsis enhanced plaque-related astrocyte activation and complement C4b gene expression in the brain, both of which may play a role in modulating amyloid formation. CLP also caused large scale changes in the gut microbiome of APP/PS1 mice, which have been associated with a pro-amyloidogenic and neuroinflammatory state. Conclusions: Our results suggest that experimental sepsis can exacerbate amyloid plaque deposition and plaque related inflammation, providing a potential mechanism for increased dementia in older sepsis survivors.', '']\n",

I., et al.;2016;', 'Neurodegenerative diseases comprise an array of progressive neurological disorders all characterized by the selective death of neurons in the central nervous system. Although, rare (familial) and common (sporadic) forms can occur for the same disease, it is unclear whether this reflects several distinct pathogenic pathways or the convergence of different causes into a common form of nerve cell death. Remarkably, neurodegenerative diseases are increasingly found to be accompanied by activation of the innate immune surveillance system normally associated with pathogen recognition and response. Innate surveillance is the cell\\'s quality control system for the purpose of detecting such danger signals and responding in an appropriate manner. Innate surveillance is an \"intelligent system,\" in that the manner of response is relevant to the magnitude and duration of the threat. If possible, the threat is dealt with within the cell in which it is detected, by degrading the danger signal(s) and restoring homeostasis. If this is not successful then an inflammatory response is instigated that is aimed at restricting the spread of the threat by elevating degradative pathways, sensitizing neighboring cells, and recruiting specialized cell types to the site. If the danger signal persists, then the ultimate response can include not only the programmed cell death of the original cell, but the contents of this dead cell can also bring about the death of adjacent sensitized cells. These responses are clearly aimed at destroying the ability of the detected pathogen to propagate and spread. Innate surveillance comprises intracellular, extracellular, non-cell autonomous and systemic processes. Recent studies have revealed how multiple steps in these processes involve proteins that, through their mutation, have been linked to many familial forms of neurodegenerative disease. This suggests that individuals harboring these mutations may have an amplified response to innate-mediated damage in neural tissues, and renders innate surveillance mediated cell death a plausible common pathogenic pathway responsible for neurodegenerative diseases, in both familial and sporadic forms. Here we have assembled evidence in favor of the hypothesis that neurodegenerative disease is the cumulative result of chronic activation of the innate surveillance pathway, triggered by endogenous or environmental danger or damage associated molecular patterns in a progressively expanding cascade of inflammation, tissue damage and cell death.', '']\n",

When a strong HPV-16 infection is found in the oral cavity, repeated exposure to the infected individual's coughing can infect others easily through saliva. Just like all of above cancer tissues, all 20 Alzheimer's cases that were examined had significantly increased HPV-16 of 1500 similar to 3000ng with markedly reduced Acetylcholine of 0.5 similar to 1.5ng and significantly increased beta-amyloid (1-42) of 7.5ng or higher. Since every cancer and Alzheimer's patient examined had significantly reduced amounts of Vitamin D-3 and Taurine, the author examined the effects of Vitamin D-3 and Taurine independently, or by combination. Each of optimal doses of Vitamin D-3 and Taurine had significant beneficial effects that were anti-cancer, anti-cardiac ischemia, and memory loss & other brain problems, with significant excretion of HPV-16 and bacteria such as Borrelia Burgdorferi, if it exists, through the urine, without using any anti-viral or anti-bacterial agents. However, when optimal doses of Taurine and Vitamin D-3 were used together, 3 times/day, there was reduction of cancer-associated Oncogene CfosAB-2 or Integrin alpha 5 beta 1 with significantly high values of 200 similar to 500ng which were reduced to 0.001 similar to 0.004ng. Memory and brain function improved by increasing markedly reduced abnormal Acetylcholine of 1.5ng or less to a few hundred similar to 2500ng with increase in DHEA. Abnormally increased beta-amyloid (1-42) is markedly reduced. Ischemic heart, where there is abnormally increased Cardiac Troponin I, reduced significantly. In addition, abnormally reduced DHEA levels often increase. HPV-16 in urine increased from an average of 100 similar to 115ng to an average of 4000ng and cancer related parameters in the urine significantly increased. Thus, the author found combined use of optimal dose of Vitamin D-3 400 I.U. and optimal dose of Taurine 175mg, 3/day, was found to be one of the safest, most effective treatments for cancer, memory problems & other brain abnormality, and Ischemic heart problems, and this combination seems to improve any part of the body.

Because Abeta oligomers are possibly the major toxic species in AD, they are a promising biomarker candidate for the early diagnosis of the disease. To date, a variety of oligomer-specific assays have been developed, many of them ELISAs. Here, we demonstrate the sFIDA assay, a technology highly specific for Abeta oligomers developed toward single particle sensitivity. By spiking stabilized Abeta oligomers to buffer and to body fluids from control donors, we show that the sFIDA readout correlates with the applied concentration of stabilized oligomers diluted in buffer, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and blood plasma over several orders of magnitude. The lower limit of detection was calculated to be 22 fM of stabilized oligomers diluted in PBS, 18 fM in CSF, and 14 fM in blood plasma.\", '']\n",

These proteins and their biochemical modifications can be potentially targeted for therapy or used as biomarkers. Despite a plethora of modifications demonstrated for different neurodegeneration-related proteins, such as amyloid-beta, prion protein, tau, alpha-synuclein, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), or fused in sarcoma protein (FUS), molecular classification of NDDs relies on detailed morphological evaluation of protein deposits, their distribution in the brain, and their correlation to clinical symptoms together with specific genetic alterations. A further facet of the neuropathology-based classification is the fact that many protein deposits show a hierarchical involvement of brain regions. This has been shown for Alzheimer and Parkinson disease and some forms of tauopathies and TDP-43 proteinopathies. The present paper aims to summarize current molecular classification of NDDs, focusing on the most relevant biochemical and morphological aspects. Since the combination of proteinopathies is frequent, definition of novel clusters of patients with NDDs needs to be considered in the era of precision medicine. Optimally, neuropathological categorizing of NDDs should be translated into in vivo detectable biomarkers to support better prediction of prognosis and stratification of patients for therapy trials.', '']\n",

Cognitive symptoms appear only decades after the molecular disease onset, further complicating analyses. As a consequence, molecular research is often restricted to late-stage post-mortem studies of brain tissue. However, the disease process is expected to trigger numerous cellular signaling pathways and modulate the local and systemic environment, and resulting changes in secreted signaling molecules carry information about otherwise inaccessible pathological processes. RESULTS: To access this information we probed relative levels of close to 600 secreted signaling proteins from patients' blood samples using antibody microarrays and mapped disease-specific molecular networks. Using these networks as seeds we then employed independent genome and transcriptome data sets to corroborate potential pathogenic pathways. CONCLUSIONS: We identified Growth-Differentiation Factor (GDF) signaling as a novel Alzheimer's disease-relevant pathway supported by in vivo and in vitro follow-up experiments, demonstrating the existence of a highly informative link between cellular pathology and changes in circulatory signaling proteins.\", '']\n",

TREM2 is expressed on microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain and has been linked to phagocytotic clearance of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques. Soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) has previously been measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by ELISA but in our hands commercial kits have proved unreliable, suggesting that other methods may be required. We developed a mass spectrometry method using selected reaction monitoring for the presence of a TREM2 peptide, which can be used to quantify levels of sTREM2 in CSF. FINDINGS: We examined CSF samples from memory clinics in Sweden and the UK. For all samples the following were available: clinical diagnosis, age, sex, and measurements of the CSF AD biomarkers Abeta42, T-tau and P-tau181. AD patients (n = 37) all met biomarker (IWG2) criteria for AD. Control individuals (n = 22) were cognitively normal without evidence for AD in CSF. We found significantly higher sTREM2 concentration in AD compared to control CSF. There were significant correlations between CSF sTREM2 and T-tau as well as P-tau181. CSF sTREM2 increase in AD was replicated in a second, independent cohort consisting of 24 AD patients and 16 healthy volunteers. CONCLUSION: CSF concentrations of sTREM2 are higher in AD than in controls, and correlate with markers of neurodegeneration. CSF sTREM2 may be used to quantify glial activation in AD.\", '']\n",

This diet was fed to aging C57BL/6J (B6) mice to identify phenotypes that may increase susceptibility to AD, and to APP/PS1 mice, a mouse model of AD, to determine the effects of the diet in AD. Astrocytosis and microglia/monocyte activation were dramatically increased in response to diet and was further increased in APP/PS1 mice fed the western diet.

METHODS: Twenty patients with AD [Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score 10-20 inclusive] with positive florbetapir scans were randomized to receive 300 mg of bexarotene or placebo for 4 weeks. The amyloid imaging result was the primary outcome. Whole-population analyses and prespecified analyses by genotype [apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (ApoE4) carriers and ApoE4 noncarriers] were conducted. Secondary outcomes included scores on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living scale, MMSE, Clinical Dementia Rating scale, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Serum amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide sequences Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 measurements were collected as biomarker outcomes. RESULTS: There was no change in the composite or regional amyloid burden when all patients were included in the analysis. ApoE4 noncarriers showed a significant reduction in brain amyloid on the composite measure in five of six regional measurements. No change in amyloid burden was observed in ApoE4 carriers. There was a significant association between increased serum Abeta1-42 and reductions in brain amyloid in ApoE4 noncarriers (not in carriers). There were significant elevations in serum triglycerides in bexarotene-treated patients. There was no consistent change in any clinical measure. CONCLUSIONS: The primary outcome of this trial was negative. The data suggest that bexarotene reduced brain amyloid and increased serum Abeta1-42 in ApoE4 noncarriers. Elevated triglycerides could represent a cardiovascular risk, and bexarotene should not be administered outside a research setting. RXR agonists warrant further investigations as AD therapies.

Despite age being the greatest risk factor for AD, the molecular mechanisms linking ageing to APP processing are unknown. Here we show that asparagine endopeptidase (AEP), a pH-controlled cysteine proteinase, is activated during ageing and mediates APP proteolytic processing. AEP cleaves APP at N373 and N585 residues, selectively influencing the amyloidogenic fragmentation of APP. AEP is activated in normal mice in an age-dependent manner, and is strongly activated in 5XFAD transgenic mouse model and human AD brains. Deletion of AEP from 5XFAD or APP/PS1 mice decreases senile plaque formation, ameliorates synapse loss, elevates long-term potentiation and protects memory. Blockade of APP cleavage by AEP in mice alleviates pathological and behavioural deficits.

For this, we have used two highly amyloidogenic peptides: amyloid-beta (A beta) from Alzheimer's disease and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) associated with type II diabetes. Using a well-plate reader, we show all three fluorophores can report the kinetics of fiber formation. Indeed, bis-ANS is markedly more sensitive to fiber detection than ThT and has a submicromolar affinity for A beta fibers. Furthermore, we show that fluorescence detection is very sensitive to the presence of excess fluorophore. In particular, beyond a 1:1 stoichiometry these probes demonstrate marked fluorescence quenching, for both A beta and IAPP. Indeed, the fiber-associated fluorescence signal is almost completely quenched in the presence of excess ThT. There is also intense interest in the detection of prefibrillar amyloid assemblies, as oligomers and protofibrils are believed to be highly cytotoxic. We generate stable, fiber-free, prefibrillar assemblies of A beta and survey their fluorescence with ANTS and bis-ANS. Fluorescence from ANS has often been used as a marker for oligomers; however, we show ANS can fluoresce more strongly in the presence of fibers and should therefore be used as a probe for oligomers with caution.\", '']\n",

RESULTS: A combination of 1C22 for capture and 3D6 for detection yielded an Erenna immunoassay with a lower limit of quantification of approximately 0.15 pg/ml that was highly selective for oligomers over monomers and detected a wide size-range of oligomers. Most CSFs we tested had detectable oligomer levels but with a large overlap between AD and controls and a trend for higher mean levels in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) than controls.

The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of underweight, overweight, obesity and central obesity in 7-year-old to 10-year-old urban children and to compare the results obtained through various standards of BMI or waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) indicators. METHODS: The research was conducted on a sample group of 367 girls and 424 boys aged 6.5-10.5 years, randomly chosen from a number of primary schools in Warsaw, Poland. In all participants, basic somatic features were assessed, and based on BMI and WHtR values, participants were then classified according to different standards. The prevalence of underweight, overweight, obesity and central obesity in boys and girls was compared using the chi-square test; fractions obtained from various BMI and WHtR standards were compared through a test for proportions; and the conformity of classification methods was assessed using Cohen's kappa coefficient. RESULTS: Approximately 9% of girls and 6% of boys were underweight, 15% of all participants was classified as overweight, and approximately 4% of girls and 6% of boys aged 7-10 were obese. Central obesity was diagnosed in 18.6-20.9% of all participants, while another 7.1% of girls and 7.5% of boys displayed symptoms of excessive fat deposition characterized by elevated body fat percentages. Even though the prevalence estimations varied depending on the standards used, the overall classification compliance reached 86-94% with a Cohen's kappa coefficient ranging from 0.676 to 0.841. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of underweight, overweight and obesity among urban children is comparable to estimates for the general population. Of particular concern, in terms of health and proper physical development, is the problem of central obesity that affects one out of five children. The use of reference values representing body fat percentage seems justified as it allows for a more precise diagnosis of weight-related disorders, including the particularly threatening abdominal obesity.\", '']\n",

Satisfactory convergent and discriminant validity of the IOF QLQ was seen. CONCLUSIONS: The Polish version of the IOF QLQ for patients with a DRF is a reliable and valid tool for measuring HRQoL. It can be fully recommended for use in clinical settings in the Polish population. When combined with the SF-36 the IOF QLQ allows to obtain a comprehensive HRQoL assessment in patients with a DRF.', '']\n",

The objective of this study was to analyze the efficacy of intramuscularly administered drotaverine hydrochloride in the prevention of POUR in orthopedic patients. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty patients 17-40 years of age undergoing lower limb orthopedic procedures under spinal anesthesia were enrolled in the study. The study group received 40 mg of drotaverine hydrochloride intramuscularly; the second group was the control. The main outcome measure was (1) the time to micturition and (2) the incidence of urinary bladder catheterization and time to catheterization.

METHODS: Ten normal young volunteers (young control, 21-30 years old), ten normal senior volunteers (senior control, 60-78 years old, MMSE >/= 29), and ten Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients (study group, 59-84 years old, MMSE: 13-19) participated in this study. All AD patients were diagnosed by neurologists specializing in dementia based on DSM-IV criteria. CSF dynamics were analyzed using positron emission tomography (PET) following an intravenous injection of 1,000 MBq [15O]H2O synthesized on-line. RESULTS: Water influx into CSF space in AD patients, expressed as influx ratio, (0.755 +/- 0.089) was significantly reduced compared to young controls (1.357 +/- 0.185; p < 0.001) and also compared to normal senior controls (0.981 +/- 0.253, p < 0.05). Influx ratio in normal senior controls was significantly reduced compared to young controls (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Water influx into the CSF is significantly reduced in AD patients. beta-amyloid clearance has been shown to be dependent on interstitial flow and CSF production. The current study indicates that reduction in water influx into the CSF may disturb the clearance rate of beta-amyloid, and therefore be linked to the pathogenesis of AD.

We take a transcriptomics approach to build the first reproducible multi-tissue RNA expression signature by gene-chip profiling tissue from sedentary normal subjects who reached 65 years of age in good health. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty probe-sets form an accurate classifier of young versus older muscle tissue and this healthy ageing RNA classifier performed consistently in independent cohorts of human muscle, skin and brain tissue (n = 594, AUC = 0.83-0.96) and thus represents a biomarker for biological age. Using the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men birth-cohort (n = 108) we demonstrate that the RNA classifier is insensitive to confounding lifestyle biomarkers, while greater gene score at age 70 years is independently associated with better renal function at age 82 years and longevity. The gene score is 'up-regulated' in healthy human hippocampus with age, and when applied to blood RNA profiles from two large independent age-matched dementia case-control data sets (n = 717) the healthy controls have significantly greater gene scores than those with cognitive impairment. Alone, or when combined with our previously described prototype Alzheimer disease (AD) RNA 'disease signature', the healthy ageing RNA classifier is diagnostic for AD. CONCLUSIONS: We identify a novel and statistically robust multi-tissue RNA signature of human healthy ageing that can act as a diagnostic of future health, using only a peripheral blood sample. This RNA signature has great potential to assist research aimed at finding treatments for and/or management of AD and other ageing-related conditions.\", '']\n",

J., et al.;2015;', 'BACKGROUND: Engineered nanoparticles (NPs) can induce platelet activation and aggregation, but the mechanisms underlying these interactions are not well understood. This could be due in part to use of devices that study platelet function under quasi-static conditions with low sensitivity to measure platelet microaggregation. Therefore, in this study we investigated the pharmacological pathways and regulators of NP-induced platelet microaggregation under flow conditions at nanoscale using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) and compared the data thus obtained with those generated by light aggregometry. METHODS: Blood was collected from healthy volunteers, and platelet-rich plasma was obtained. Thrombin receptor-activating peptide, a potent stimulator of platelet function, and pharmacological inhibitors were used to modulate platelet microaggregation in the presence/absence of silica (10 nm and 50 nm) and polystyrene (23 nm) NPs. Light aggregometry was used to study platelet aggregation in macroscale. Optical, immunofluorescence, and scanning electron microscopy were also used to visualize platelet aggregates. RESULTS: Platelet microaggregation was enhanced by thrombin receptor-activating peptide, whereas prostacyclin, nitric oxide donors, acetylsalicylic acid, and phenanthroline, but not adenosine diphosphate (ADP) blockers, were able to inhibit platelet microaggregation. NPs caused platelet microaggregation, an effect not detectable by light aggregometry. NP-induced microaggregation was attenuated by platelet inhibitors. CONCLUSION: NP-induced platelet microaggregation appears to involve classical proaggregatory pathways (thromboxane A2-mediated and matrix metalloproteinase-2-mediated) and can be regulated by endogenous (prostacyclin) and pharmacological (acetylsalicylic acid, phenanthroline, and nitric oxide donors) inhibitors of platelet function. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, but not light aggregometry, is an appropriate method for studying NP-induced microaggregation.', '']\n",

The accessory head of the flexor pollicis longus muscle (AHFPL), also known as the Gantzer's muscle, was first described in 1813. The prevalence rates of an AHFPL significantly vary between studies, and no consensus has been reached on the numerous variations reported in its origin, innervation, and relationships to the Anterior Interosseous Nerve (AIN) and the Median Nerve (MN). The aim of our study was to determine the true prevalence of AHFPL and to study its associated anatomical characteristics. Methods. A search of the major electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science was performed to identify all articles reporting data on the prevalence of AHPFL in the population. No date or language restriction was set. Additionally, an extensive search of the references of all relevant articles was performed. Data on the prevalence of the AHFPL in upper limbs and its anatomical characteristics and relationships including origin, insertion, innervation, and position was extracted and pooled into a meta-analysis using MetaXL version 2.0. Results. A total of 24 cadaveric studies (n = 2,358 upper limb) were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of an AHFPL was 44.2% (95% CI [0.347-0.540]). An AHFPL was found more commonly in men than in women (41.1% vs. 24.1%), and was slightly more prevalent on the right side than on the left side (52.8% vs. 45.2%). The most common origin of the AHFPL was from the medial epicondyle of the humerus with a pooled prevalence of 43.6% (95% CI [0.166-0.521]). In most cases, the AHFPL inserted into the flexor pollicis longus muscle (94.6%, 95% CI [0.731-1.0]) and was innervated by the AIN (97.3%, 95% CI [0.924-0.993]). Conclusion. The AHFPL should be considered as more a part of normal anatomy than an anatomical variant. The variability in its anatomical characteristics, and its potential to cause compression of the AIN and MN, must be taken into account by physicians to avoid iatrogenic injury during decompression procedures and to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of Anterior Interosseous Nerve Syndrome.\", '']\n",

RESULTS: In this study we used in vitro and in vivo models of amyloid synaptotoxicity to investigate effects of amyloid peptides on hippocampal mushroom spines. We discovered that application of Abeta42 oligomers to hippocampal cultures or injection of Abeta42 oligomers directly into hippocampal region resulted in reduction of mushroom spines and activity of synaptic calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). We further discovered that expression of STIM2 protein rescued CaMKII activity and protected mushroom spines from amyloid toxicity in vitro and in vivo.

Notch activation has been implicated in tumorigenesis in an increasing number of human malignancies including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, Notch1 in distinct expression patterns and activation status with tumor progression remains to be defined in NSCLC. METHODS: Notch1 and activated Notch1, N1-ICD, were examined by immunohistochemistry in 58 cases of stage I to IV NSCLC tumors. Association between Notch1 or N1-ICD expression and clinicopathological factors was assessed via correlation coefficient r statistics. P-values are two-sided. RESULTS: Detectable tumor Notch1, predominantly localized to the membrane and cytoplasm, was observed in 29 cases (50%, 95% Blyth-Still-Casella confidence interval 37 - 63%). It was negatively associated with stage (r=- 0.43, P<0.001) and nodal status (r=- 0.33, P = 0.01), but not tumor size. In contrast, nuclear N1-ICD expression level was low and found in 12% of NSCLC patients, neither significantly associated with stage nor nodal status. Upon Notch1 activation in vitro, a mostly extra-nuclear staining was substantially turned into the nuclear signal in cancer cells.

Interactions between genes of importance to cardiovascular regulation may account for some of the missing heritability of CAD. This study aimed to investigate the role of gene-gene interactions in common variants in candidate cardiovascular genes in CAD. APPROACH AND RESULTS: 2,101 patients with CAD from the British Heart Foundation Family Heart Study and 2,426 CAD-free controls were included in the discovery cohort. All subjects were genotyped with the Illumina HumanCVD BeadChip enriched for genes and pathways relevant to the cardiovascular system and disease. The primary analysis in the discovery cohort examined pairwise interactions among 913 common (minor allele frequency >0.1) independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with at least nominal association with CAD in single locus analysis. A secondary exploratory interaction analysis was performed among all 11,332 independent common SNPs surviving quality control criteria. Replication analyses were conducted in 2,967 patients and 3,075 controls from the Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium. None of the interactions amongst 913 SNPs analysed in the primary analysis was statistically significant after correction for multiple testing (required P<1.2x10-7). Similarly, none of the pairwise gene-gene interactions in the secondary analysis reached statistical significance after correction for multiple testing (required P = 7.8x10-10). None of 36 suggestive interactions from the primary analysis or 31 interactions from the secondary analysis was significant in the replication cohort. Our study had 80% power to detect odds ratios > 1.7 for common variants in the primary analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Moderately large additive interactions between common SNPs in genes relevant to cardiovascular disease do not appear to play a major role in genetic predisposition to CAD. The role of genetic interactions amongst less common SNPs and with medium and small magnitude effects remain to be investigated.', '']\n",

A significant proportion of the amyloid-binding proteins (more than 30%) are differentially expressed or altered/oxidatively modified in AD patients. Incubation of brain homogenates with 70 microM hydrogen peroxide significantly influenced the profile of amyloid-beta binding proteins and 0.1 mM isatin decreased the number of identified amyloid-beta binding proteins both in control and hydrogen peroxide treated brain homogenates. The effects of hydrogen peroxide and isatin have been confirmed in optical biosensor experiments with purified glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, one of the known crucial amyloid-beta binding proteins (also identified in this study).

Their ability to self-renew and differentiate into several lineages makes them a promising tool for cell-based therapies in different types of degenerative diseases. Thus it is crucial to evaluate age-related changes in hASCs, as the elderly are a group that will benefit most from their considerable potential. In this study we investigated the effect of donor age on growth kinetics, cellular senescence marker levels, and osteogenic and adipogenic potential of hASCs. It also has been known that, during life, organisms accumulate oxidative damage that negatively affects cell metabolism. Taking this into consideration, we evaluated the levels of nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species, and superoxide dismutase activity. We observed that ROS and NO increase with aging, while SOD activity is significantly reduced. Moreover cells obtained from older patients displayed senescence associated features, for example, beta-galactosidase activity, enlarged morphology, and p53 protein upregulation. All of those characteristics seem to contribute to decreased proliferation potential of those cells. Our results suggest that due to aging some cellular modification may be required before applying aged cells efficiently in therapies such as tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.', '']\n",

G., et al.;2015;\", \"BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that recognize sites of complementarity of target messenger RNAs, resulting in transcriptional regulation and translational repression of target genes. In Huntington's disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disease caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion, miRNA dyregulation has been reported, which may impact gene expression and modify the progression and severity of HD. METHODS: We performed next-generation miRNA sequence analysis in prefrontal cortex (Brodmann Area 9) from 26 HD, 2 HD gene positive, and 36 control brains. Neuropathological information was available for all HD brains, including age at disease onset, CAG-repeat size, Vonsattel grade, and Hadzi-Vonsattel striatal and cortical scores, a continuous measure of the extent of neurodegeneration. Linear models were performed to examine the relationship of miRNA expression to these clinical features, and messenger RNA targets of associated miRNAs were tested for gene ontology term enrichment. RESULTS: We identified 75 miRNAs differentially expressed in HD brain (FDR q-value <0.05). Among the HD brains, nine miRNAs were significantly associated with Vonsattel grade of neuropathological involvement and three of these, miR-10b-5p, miR-10b-3p, and miR-302a-3p, significantly related to the Hadzi-Vonsattel striatal score (a continuous measure of striatal involvement) after adjustment for CAG length. Five miRNAs (miR-10b-5p, miR-196a-5p, miR-196b-5p, miR-10b-3p, and miR-106a-5p) were identified as having a significant relationship to CAG length-adjusted age of onset including miR-10b-5p, the mostly strongly over-expressed miRNA in HD cases. Although prefrontal cortex was the source of tissue profiled in these studies, the relationship of miR-10b-5p expression to striatal involvement in the disease was independent of cortical involvement. Correlation of miRNAs to the clinical features clustered by direction of effect and the gene targets of the observed miRNAs showed association to processes relating to nervous system development and transcriptional regulation. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that miRNA expression in cortical BA9 provides insight into striatal involvement and support a role for these miRNAs, particularly miR-10b-5p, in HD pathogenicity. The miRNAs identified in our studies of postmortem brain tissue may be detectable in peripheral fluids and thus warrant consideration as accessible biomarkers for disease stage, rate of progression, and other important clinical characteristics of HD.\", '']\n",

Due to significant differences in the reported prevalence of such variations, extensive knowledge on the anatomy of the MN is essential to avoid iatrogenic nerve injury. Our aim was to determine the prevalence rates of anatomical variations of the MN in the carpal tunnel and the most common course patterns and variations in its thenar motor branch (TMB). STUDY DESIGN: A systematic search of all major databases was performed to identify articles that studied the prevalence of MN variations in the carpal tunnel and the TMB. No date or language restrictions were set. Extracted data was classified according to Lanz's classification system: variations in the course of the single TMB--extraligamentous, subligamentous, and transligamentous (type 1); accessory branches of the MN at the distal carpal tunnel (type 2); high division of the MN (type 3); and the MN and its accessory branches proximal to the carpal tunnel (type 4). Pooled prevalence rates were calculated using MetaXL 2.0. RESULTS: Thirty-one studies (n = 3918 hands) were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence rates of the extraligamentous, subligamentous, and transligamentous courses were 75.2% (95%CI:55.4%-84.7%), 13.5% (95%CI:3.6%-25.7%), and 11.3% (95%CI:2.4%-23.0%), respectively. The prevalence of Lanz group 2, 3, and 4 were 4.6% (95%CI:1.6%-9.1%), 2.6% (95%CI:0.1%-2.8%), and 2.3% (95%CI:0.3%-5.6%), respectively. Ulnar side of branching of the TMB was found in 2.1% (95%CI:0.9%-3.6%) of hands. The prevalence of hypertrophic thenar muscles over the transverse carpal ligament was 18.2% (95%CI:6.8%-33.0%). A transligamentous course of the TMB was more commonly found in hands with hypertrophic thenar muscles (23.4%, 95%CI:5.0%-43.4%) compared to those without hypertrophic musculature (1.7%, 95%CI:0%-100%). In four studies (n = 423 hands), identical bilateral course of the TMB was found in 72.3% (95%CI:58.4%-84.4%) of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Anatomical variations in the course of the TMB and the MN in the carpal tunnel are common in the population. Thus, we recommend an ulnar side approach to carpal tunnel release, with a careful layer by layer dissection, to avoid iatrogenic damage to the TMB.\", '']\n",

The aberrant expression of c-Met is often associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancers, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

As such, we investigated the functional impact of piperlongumine (PL), a naturally occurring alkaloid present in the Long pepper (Piper longum) on c-Met expression in RCC cells and demonstrated that PL and its analogs rapidly reduce c-Met protein and RNA levels in RCC cells via ROS-dependent mechanism. PL-mediated c-Met depletion coincided with the inhibition of downstream c-Met signaling; namely Erk/MAPK, STAT3, NF-kappaB and Akt/mTOR.

Areas uncovered by microglia are less compact but have high Abeta42 affinity, leading to the formation of protofibrillar Abeta42 hotspots that are associated with more severe axonal dystrophy. In ageing, microglia coverage is reduced leading to enlarged protofibrillar Abeta42 hotspots and more severe neuritic dystrophy.

This study aimed to investigate the comparability of two amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) tracers as well as examine how age affects the discriminative properties of amyloid PET imaging. Methods Fifty-one healthy controls (HCs), 72 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 90 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) from a European cohort were scanned with [11C]Pittsburgh compound-B (PIB) and compared with an age-, sex- and disease severity-matched population of 51 HC, 72 MCI and 84 AD patients from a North American cohort who were scanned with [18F]Florbetapir. An additional North American population of 246 HC, 342 MCI and 138 AD patients with a Florbetapir scan was split by age (55-75 vs 76-93 y) into groups matched for gender and disease severity. PET template-based analyses were used to quantify regional tracer uptake. Results The mean regional uptake patterns were similar and strong correlations were found between the two tracers across the regions of interest in HC (rho = 0.671, p = 0.02), amyloid-positive MCI (rho = 0.902, p < 0.001) and AD patients (rho = 0.853, p < 0.001). The application of the Florbetapir cut-off point resulted in a higher proportion of amyloid-positive HC and a lower proportion of amyloid-positive AD patients in the older group (28 and 30 %, respectively) than in the younger group (19 and 20 %, respectively). Conclusions These results illustrate the comparability of Florbetapir and PIB in unrelated but matched patient populations.

However, experiments developed to explore the interaction between neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology showed a surprising reduction in amyloid beta (Abeta) plaque deposition. We sought to understand this unexpected outcome by examining microglia phenotypes during chronic neuroinflammation. METHODS: Using an adeno-associated virus vector carrying hIL-1beta cDNA, inflammation was induced in one hippocampus of 8-month-old amyloid precursor protein (APP)/PS1 mice for 4 weeks, while the other hemisphere received control injections. Bone marrow chimeras and staining analysis were used to identify the origins and types of immune cells present during sustained inflammation. Arginase 1 (Arg1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) immunoreactivity were used as markers of alternatively activated and classically activated cells, respectively, and changes in cellular uptake of Abeta by Arg1+ or iNOS+ microglia was demonstrated by confocal microscopy. To determine if an anti-inflammatory phenotype was present during neuroinflammation, RNA was extracted on flow-sorted microglia and rt-PCR was performed. Interleukin-4 injection was used to induce alternatively activated cells, whereas a minipump and intrahippocampal cannula was used to deliver an interleukin (IL)-4Ralpha antibody to block the induction of Arg1+ cells in the setting of sustained IL-1beta expression. RESULTS: We observed a robust upregulation of centrally derived Arg1+ microglia present only in the inflamed hemisphere. Furthermore, in the inflamed hemisphere, greater numbers of Arg1+ microglia contained Abeta when compared to iNOS+ microglia. RNA isolated from flow-sorted microglia from the inflamed hemisphere demonstrated elevation of mRNA species consistent with alternative activation as well as neuroprotective genes such as BDNF and IGF1. To explore if Arg1+ microglia mediated plaque reduction, we induced Arg1+ microglia with IL-4 and observed significant plaque clearance. Moreover, when we reduced Arg1+ microglia induction in the context of neuroinflammation using an anti-IL-4Ralpha antibody delivered via intrahippocampal cannula, we observed a clear correlation between numbers of Arg1+ microglia and plaque reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings suggest that Arg1+ microglia are involved in Abeta plaque reduction during sustained, IL-1beta-dependent neuroinflammation, opening up possible new avenues for immunomodulatory therapy of AD.\", '']\n",

The assessment of mental health used a Polish version of the international Goldberger's General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). ANOVA (1- and 2-factor) analysis of variance, Tukey's test, and Pearson's simple correlation were used to analyze the significance of differences, with the significance level set at alpha=0.05. RESULTS: All patients with chronic back pain, regardless of their age and gender, displayed poorer mental well-being compared to the control group: their overall score was higher by over 7 points than in persons without back pain (F1.96=14.8; p<0.001). Men with back pain were significantly more susceptible to depression than women (F2.96=5.5; p<0.05), compared to the control group.

With the expected aging of the human population, the estimated morbidity of AD suggests a critical upcoming health problem. Several lines of research are focused on understanding AD pathophysiology, and although the etiology of the disease remains a matter of intense debate, increased brain levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta) appear to be a critical event in triggering a wide range of molecular alterations leading to AD. It has become evident in recent years that an altered balance between production and clearance is responsible for the accumulation of brain Abeta. Moreover, Abeta clearance is a complex event that involves more than neurons and microglia. The status of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and choroid plexus, along with hepatic functionality, should be considered when Abeta balance is addressed. Furthermore, it has been proposed that exposure to sub-toxic concentrations of metals, such as copper, could both directly affect these secondary structures and act as a seeding or nucleation core that facilitates Abeta aggregation. Recently, we have addressed peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)-related mechanisms, including the direct modulation of mitochondrial dynamics through the PPARgamma-coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) axis and the crosstalk with critical aging- and neurodegenerative-related cellular pathways. In the present review, we revise the current knowledge regarding the molecular aspects of Abeta production and clearance and provide a physiological context that gives a more complete view of this issue. Additionally, we consider the different structures involved in AD-altered Abeta brain balance, which could be directly or indirectly affected by a nuclear receptor (NR)/PPAR-related mechanism.\", '']\n",

      "['3888418;24427295;MR-less surface-based amyloid assessment based on 11C PiB PET;Zhou, L., et al.;2014;', \"BACKGROUND: beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques in brain's grey matter (GM) are one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and can be imaged in vivo using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with (11)C or (18)F radiotracers. Estimating Abeta burden in cortical GM has been shown to improve diagnosis and monitoring of AD. However, lacking structural information in PET images requires such assessments to be performed with anatomical MRI scans, which may not be available at different clinical settings or being contraindicated for particular reasons. This study aimed to develop an MR-less Abeta imaging quantification method that requires only PET images for reliable Abeta burden estimations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The proposed method has been developed using a multi-atlas based approach on (11)C-PiB scans from 143 subjects (75 PiB+ and 68 PiB- subjects) in AIBL study. A subset of 20 subjects (PET and MRI) were used as atlases: 1) MRI images were co-registered with tissue segmentation; 2) 3D surface at the GM-WM interfacing was extracted and registered to a canonical space; 3) Mean PiB retention within GM was estimated and mapped to the surface. For other participants, each atlas PET image (and surface) was registered to the subject's PET image for PiB estimation within GM. The results are combined by subject-specific atlas selection and Bayesian fusion to generate estimated surface values. RESULTS: All PiB+ subjects (N = 75) were highly correlated between the MR-dependent and the PET-only methods with Intraclass Correlation (ICC) of 0.94, and an average relative difference error of 13% (or 0.23 SUVR) per surface vertex. All PiB- subjects (N = 68) revealed visually akin patterns with a relative difference error of 16% (or 0.19 SUVR) per surface vertex. CONCLUSION: The demonstrated accuracy suggests that the proposed method could be an effective clinical inspection tool for Abeta imaging scans when MRI images are unavailable.\", '']\n",

This system allowed us to examine Abeta metabolism in vivo, and test the effects of both aging and APOE genotype, two of the strongest risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. We injected the Abeta1-42 lentivirus into the motor cortex of young (2 month old) and old (20-22 month old) APOE3 and APOE4 mice. After 2 weeks of lentiviral expression, we analyzed the pattern of Abeta accumulation, glial activation, and phosphor-tau. In young mice, Abeta accumulated mainly within neurons with no evidence of extracellular Abeta. Significantly higher levels of intraneuronal Abeta were observed in APOE4 mice compared to APOE3 mice. In old mice, APOE4 predisposed again to higher levels of Abeta accumulation, but the Abeta was mainly in extracellular spaces. In younger mice, we also observed Abeta in microglia but not astrocytes. The numbers of microglia containing Abeta were significantly higher in APOE3 mice compared to APOE4 mice, and were significantly lower in both genetic backgrounds with aging. The astrocytes in old mice were activated to a greater extent in the brain regions where Abeta was introduced, an effect that was again increased by the presence of APOE4. Finally, phospho-tau accumulated in the region of Abeta expression, with evidence of extracellular phospho-tau increasing with aging. These data suggest that APOE4 predisposes to less microglial clearance of Abeta, leading to more intraneuronal accumulation. In older brains, decreased clearance leads to more extracellular Abeta, and more downstream consequences relating to astrocyte activation and phospho-tau accumulation. We conclude that both aging and APOE genotype affect pathways related to Abeta metabolism by microglia.\", '']\n",

It remains unknown, however, if O-GlcNAc can influence the formation of amyloid plaques in the presence of tau pathology. RESULTS: We treated double transgenic TAPP mice, which express both mutant human tau and amyloid precursor protein (APP), with a highly selective orally bioavailable inhibitor of the enzyme responsible for removing O-GlcNAc (OGA) to increase O-GlcNAc in the brain. We find that increased O-GlcNAc levels block cognitive decline in the TAPP mice and this effect parallels decreased beta-amyloid peptide levels and decreased levels of amyloid plaques.

However, the brain region specificity of caspase-independent PCD in AD-associated neurodegeneration is unknown. We therefore used the transgenic CRND8 (TgCRND8) AD mouse model to explore whether the apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), a key mediator of caspase-independent PCD, contributes to cell loss in selected brain regions in the course of aging. RESULTS: Increased expression of truncated AIF (tAIF), which is directly responsible for cell death induction, was observed at both 4- and 6-months of age in the cortex. Concomitant with the up-regulation of tAIF was an increase in the nuclear translocation of this protein. Heightened tAIF expression or translocation was not observed in the hippocampus or cerebellum, which were used as AD-vulnerable and relatively AD-spared regions, respectively. The cortical alterations in tAIF levels were accompanied by increased Bax expression and mitochondrial translocation. This effect was preceded by a significant reduction in ATP content and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, detectable at 2 months of age despite negligible amounts of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data suggest that AIF is likely to play a region-specific role in AD-related caspase-independent PCD, which is consistent with aging-associated mitochondrial impairment and oxidative stress.\", '']\n",

Using the CT Perfusion (CTP) functional imaging, we sought to investigate the interaction between CI and the Abeta protein on cerebral hemodynamics. METHODS: A previously established rat model of CI and Abeta was used for the CTP study. Iodinated contrast was given intravenously, while serial CT images of sixteen axial slices were acquired. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood volume (CBV) parametric maps were co-registered to a rat brain atlas and regions of interest were drawn on the maps. Microvascular alteration was investigated with histopathology. RESULTS: CTP results revealed that ipsilateral striatum of Abeta+CI and CI groups showed significantly lower CBF and CBV than control at the acute phase. Striatal CBF and CBV increased significantly at week 1 in the CI and Abeta+CI groups, but not in the Abeta alone or control group. Histopathology showed that average density of dilated microvessels in the ipsilateral striatum in CI and Abeta+CI groups was significantly higher than control at week 1, indicating this could be associated with hyperperfusion and hypervolemia observed from CTP results.

Fantini;2014;\", \"A broad range of microbial and amyloid proteins interact with cell surface glycolipids which behave as infectivity and/or toxicity cofactors in human pathologies. Here we have deciphered the biochemical code that determines the glycolipid-binding specificity of two major amyloid proteins, Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) and Parkinson's disease associated protein alpha-synuclein. We showed that both proteins interact with selected glycolipids through a common loop-shaped motif exhibiting little sequence homology. This 12-residue domain corresponded to fragments 34-45 of alpha-synuclein and 5-16 of Abeta. By modulating the amino acid sequence of alpha-synuclein at only two positions in which we introduced a pair of histidine residues found in Abeta, we created a chimeric alpha-synuclein/Abeta peptide with extended ganglioside-binding properties. This chimeric peptide retained the property of alpha-synuclein to recognize GM3, and acquired the capacity to recognize GM1 (an Abeta-inherited characteristic). Free histidine (but not tryptophan or asparagine) and Zn2+ (but not Na+) prevented this interaction, confirming the key role of His-13 and His-14 in ganglioside binding. Molecular dynamics studies suggested that the chimeric peptide recognized cholesterol-constrained conformers of GM1, including typical chalice-shaped dimers, that are representative of the condensed cholesterol-ganglioside complexes found in lipid raft domains of the plasma membrane of neural cells. Correspondingly, the peptide had a particular affinity for raft-like membranes containing both GM1 and cholesterol. The chimeric peptide also interacted with several other gangliosides, including major brain gangliosides (GM4, GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b) but not with neutral glycolipids such as GlcCer, LacCer or asialo-GM1. It could inhibit the binding of Abeta1-42 onto neural SH-SY5Y cells and did not induce toxicity in these cells. In conclusion, deciphering the glycolipid code of amyloid proteins allowed us to create a universal ganglioside-binding peptide of only 12-residues with potential therapeutic applications in infectious and neurodegenerative diseases that involve cell surface gangliosides as receptors.\", '']\n",

The present study sought to address this issue by investigating odor coding in the anterior piriform cortex, the primary cortical region involved in higher order olfactory function, and how it relates to performance on olfactory behavioral tasks. An olfactory habituation task was performed on cohorts of transgenic and age-matched wild-type mice at 3, 6 and 12 months of age. These animals were then anesthetized and acute, single-unit electrophysiology was performed in the anterior piriform cortex. In addition, in a separate group of animals, a longitudinal odor discrimination task was conducted from 3-12 months of age. Results showed that while odor habituation was impaired at all ages, Tg2576 performed comparably to age-matched wild-type mice on the olfactory discrimination task. The behavioral data mirrored intact anterior piriform cortex single-unit odor responses and receptive fields in Tg2576, which were comparable to wild-type at all age groups. The present results suggest that odor processing in the olfactory cortex and basic odor discrimination is especially robust in the face of amyloid beta precursor protein (AbetaPP) over-expression and advancing amyloid beta (Abeta) pathology. Odor identification deficits known to emerge early in Alzheimer's disease progression, therefore, may reflect impairments in linking the odor percept to associated labels in cortical regions upstream of the primary olfactory pathway, rather than in the basic odor processing itself.\", '']\n",

Using quantitative PCR assays betaA42 was shown to reduce viral uptake by epithelial cells after 45 minutes and to reduce supernatant virus at 24 hours post infection. betaA42 caused aggregation of IAV particles as detected by light transmission assays and electron and confocal microscopy. betaA42 did not stimulate neutrophil H2O2 production or extracellular trap formation on its own, but it increased both responses stimulated by IAV. In addition, betaA42 increased uptake of IAV by neutrophils. betaA42 reduced viral protein synthesis in monocytes and reduced IAV-induced interleukin-6 production by these cells. Hence, we demonstrate for the first time that betaA has antiviral activity and modulates viral interactions with phagocytes.\", '']\n",

A., et al.;2014;\", \"INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence suggests that decreased adult hippocampal neurogenesis represents an early critical event in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In mice, adult neurogenesis is reduced by knock-in alleles for human apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in4. Decreased dentate gyrus (DG) neural progenitor cells proliferation has been observed in the triple-transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD); this reduction being directly associated with the presence of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and an increase in the number of Abeta-containing neurons in the hippocampus. Cognitive tasks involving difficult pattern separations have been shown to reflect DG activity and thus potentially neurogenesis in both animals and man. This study involved the administration of a pattern separation paradigm to Alzheimer's patients to investigate relationships between task performance and both ApoE status and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta42 levels. METHODS: The CDR System pattern separation task involves the presentation of pictures that must later be discriminated from closely similar pictures. This paper presents pattern separation data from 66 mild to moderate AD patients, of which 50 were genotyped and 65 in whom CSF Abeta42 was measured. RESULTS: ApoE in4 homozygotes were not compromised on the easy pattern separations compared with the other patients, but they were statistically significantly poorer at the difficult separations. In all patients CSF Abeta42 correlated significantly with the ability to make the difficult discriminations, but not easier discriminations. Pattern separation speed correlated negatively with CSF Abeta42, and thus the association was not due to increased impulsivity. CONCLUSIONS: These are, to our knowledge, the first human pattern separation data to suggest a possible genetic link to poor hippocampal neurogenesis in AD, as well as a relationship to Abeta42. Therapies which target neurogenesis may thus be useful in preventing the early stages of AD, notably in ApoE in4 homocygotes.\", '']\n",

Short-term studies show that induction of an M1 neuroinflammatory phenotype reduces Abeta, but long-term studies have not been performed that track the neuroinflammatory phenotype. METHODS: Wild-type and APP/PS1 transgenic mice aged 3 to 4 months received a bilateral intracranial injection of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors expressing IFNgamma or green fluorescent protein in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Mice were sacrificed 4 or 6 months post-injection. ELISA measurements were used for IFNgamma protein levels and biochemical levels of Abeta. The neuroinflammatory phenotype was determined through quantitative PCR. Microglia, astrocytes, and Abeta levels were assessed with immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: AAV expressing IFNgamma induced an M1 neuroinflammatory phenotype at 4 months and a mixed phenotype along with an increase in Abeta at 6 months. Microglial staining was increased at 6 months and astrocyte staining was decreased at 4 and 6 months in mice receiving AAV expressing IFNgamma. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of IFNgamma through AAV successfully induced an M1 phenotype at 4 months that transitioned to a mixed phenotype by 6 months. This transition also appeared with an increase in amyloid burden suggesting that a mixed phenotype, or enhanced expression of M2a and M2c markers, could contribute to increasing amyloid burden and disease progression.\", '']\n",

We begin with a brief overview of the neuropathological changes seen in the AD brain and an outline of some of the clinical neuropsychological assessments used to measure cognitive deficits associated with the disease. This is followed by a critical assessment of behavioral tasks that are used in AD mice to model the cognitive changes seen in the human disease. Behavioral tests discussed include spatial memory tests [Morris water maze (MWM), radial arm water maze (RAWM), Barnes maze], associative learning tasks (passive avoidance, fear conditioning), alternation tasks (Y-Maze/T-Maze), recognition memory tasks (Novel Object Recognition), attentional tasks (3 and 5 choice serial reaction time), set-shifting tasks, and reversal learning tasks. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each of these behavioral tasks, and how they may correlate with clinical assessments in humans. Finally, the temporal progression of both cognitive and non-cognitive deficits in 10 AD mouse models (PDAPP, TG2576, APP23, TgCRND8, J20, APP/PS1, TG2576 + PS1 (M146L), APP/PS1 KI, 5xFAD, and 3xTg-AD) are discussed in detail. Mouse models of AD and the behavioral tasks used in conjunction with those models are immensely important in contributing to our knowledge of disease progression and are a useful tool to study AD pathophysiology and the resulting cognitive deficits. However, investigators need to be aware of the potential weaknesses of the available preclinical models in terms of their ability to model cognitive changes observed in human AD. It is our hope that this review will assist investigators in selecting an appropriate mouse model, and accompanying behavioral paradigms to investigate different aspects of AD pathology and disease progression.\", '']\n",

This PrP(C)-mediated zinc influx required the metal-binding octapeptide repeats in PrP(C) and the presence of the zinc permeable AMPA channel with which PrP(C) directly interacted. Together with the observation that PrP(C) is evolutionarily related to the ZIP family of zinc transporters, these studies indicate that PrP(C) plays a key role in neuronal zinc homeostasis. Therefore, PrP(C) could contribute to cognitive health and protect against age-related zinc dyshomeostasis but PrP(C) has also been identified as a receptor for amyloid-beta oligomers which accumulate in the brains of those with AD.

In this report we have studied the impact of several different PS1 FAD mutations on the integration of selected PS1 transmembrane domains and on PS1 active site conformation, and whether any effects translate to a particular amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing phenotype. Most mutations studied caused an increase in the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio, but via different mechanisms. The mutations that caused a particular large increase in the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio did also display an impaired APP intracellular domain (AICD) formation and a lower total Abeta production. Interestingly, seven mutations close to the catalytic site caused a severely impaired integration of proximal transmembrane/hydrophobic sequences into the membrane. This structural defect did not correlate to a particular APP processing phenotype. Six selected FAD mutations, all of which exhibited different APP processing profiles and impact on PS1 transmembrane domain integration, were found to display an altered active site conformation. Combined, our data suggest that FAD mutations affect the PS1 structure and active site differently, resulting in several complex APP processing phenotypes, where the most aggressive mutations in terms of increased Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio are associated with a decrease in total gamma-secretase activity.', '']\n",

One drawback in the past was that clinical trial approval was withheld because of speculation that the Abeta42 vaccine induces CD4(+) T cell infiltrations into the central nervous system. To reduce T-cell activation while concomitantly maintaining high anti-Abeta42 titers is a great challenge in immunology. METHODS: We aimed to demonstrate that coimmunization with Abeta42 protein and expression plasmid can be beneficial in a mouse AD model and can prevent inflammation. We immunized the AD mice with the coimmunization vaccine and assessed behavior change and Abeta42 deposition. Furthermore, to determine the safety of the coimmunization vaccine, we used an induced Abeta42-EAE model to mimic the meningoencephalitis that happened in the AN-1792 vaccine clinical phase II trial and tested whether the coimmunization vaccine could ameliorate T-cell-mediated brain inflammation. RESULTS: The coimmunization vaccination reduced Abeta plaques and significantly ameliorated cognitive deficit while inhibiting T-cell-mediated brain inflammation and infiltration.

However, accurate estimates of the prevalence of sexual violence among in these populations remain uncertain. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to estimate the prevalence of sexual violence among refugees and displaced persons in complex humanitarian emergencies. DATA SOURCE: We conducted systematic review of relevant literature in multiple databases (EMBASE, CINAHL, and MEDLINE) through February 2013 to identify studies. We also reviewed reference lists of included articles to identify any missing sources. STUDY SELECTION: Inclusion criteria required identification of sexual violence among refugees and internally displaced persons or those displaced by conflict in complex humanitarian settings. Studies were excluded if they did not provide female sexual violence prevalence, or that included only single case reports, anecdotes, and those that focused on displacement associated with natural disasters. After a review of 1175 citations 19 unique studies were selected. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers worked independently to identify final selection and a third reviewer adjudicated any differences. Descriptive and quantitative information was extracted; prevalence estimates were synthesized. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2. MAIN OUTCOMES: The main outcome of interest was sexual violence among female refugees and internally displaced persons in complex humanitarian settings. RESULTS: The prevalence of sexual violence was estimated at 21.4% (95% CI, 14.9-28.7; I2=98.3%), using a random effects model. Statistical heterogeneity was noted with studies using probability sampling designs reporting lower prevalence of sexual violence (21.0%, 95% CI, 13.2-30.1; I2=98.6%), compared to lower quality studies (21.7%, 95% CI, 11.5-34.2; I2=97.4%). We could not rule out the presence of publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that approximately one in five refugees or displaced women in complex humanitarian settings experienced sexual violence. However, this is likely an underestimation of the true prevalence given the multiple existing barriers associated with disclosure. The long-term health and social consequences of sexual violence for women and their families necessitate strategies to improve identification of survivors of sexual violence and increase prevention and response interventions in these complex settings.', '']\n",

The authors provided evidence that these two human variants were rare and resulted in a complete loss of CALHM1 function. Recent publicly available large-scale exome sequencing data confirmed that R154H is a rare CALHM1 variant (minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.015%), but that G330D is not (MAF = 3.5% in an African American cohort). Here, we show that both CALHM1 variants exhibited gating and permeation properties indistinguishable from wild-type CALHM1 when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. While there was also no effect of the G330D mutation on Ca2+ uptake by CALHM1 in transfected mammalian cells, the R154H mutation was associated with defects in the control by CALHM1 of both Ca2+ uptake and Abeta levels in this cell system. Together, our data show that the frequent CALHM1 G330D variant has no obvious functional consequences and is therefore unlikely to contribute to EOAD. Our data also demonstrate that the rare R154H variant interferes with CALHM1 control of cytosolic Ca2+ and Abeta accumulation.

The underlying mechanism is considered to involve excessive activation of glutamate receptors; however, the exact molecular pathway remains to be determined. Extracellular recording from the CA1 of hippocampal slices is a long-standing standard for a range of studies both in basic research and in neuropharmacology. Evoked field potentials (fEPSPs) are regarded as the input, while spiking rate is regarded as the output of the neuronal network; however, the relationship between these two phenomena is not fully clear. We investigated the relationship between spontaneous spiking and evoked fEPSPs using mouse hippocampal slices. Blocking AMPA receptors (AMPARs) with CNQX abolished fEPSPs, but left firing rate unchanged. NMDA receptor (NMDAR) blockade with MK801 decreased neuronal spiking dose dependently without altering fEPSPs. Activating NMDARs by small concentration of NMDA induced a trend of increased firing. These results suggest that fEPSPs are mediated by synaptic activation of AMPARs, while spontaneous firing is regulated by the activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs. Synaptotoxic Abeta(1-42) increased firing activity without modifying evoked fEPSPs. This hyperexcitation was prevented by ifenprodil, an antagonist of the NR2B NMDARs.

The mechanism by which TREM2 influences the susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease is currently unknown. TREM2 is expressed by microglia and is thought to regulate phagocytic and inflammatory microglial responses to brain pathology. Given that a single allele of variant TREM2, likely resulting in a loss of function, conferred an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, we tested whether loss of one functional trem2 allele would affect Abeta plaque deposition or the microglial response to Abeta pathology in APPPS1-21 mice. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in Abeta deposition in 3-month old or 7-month old APPPS1-21 mice expressing one or two copies of trem2. However, 3-month old mice with one copy of trem2 exhibited a marked decrease in the number and size of plaque-associated microglia. While there were no statistically significant differences in cytokine levels or markers of microglial activation in 3- or 7-month old animals, there were trends towards decreased expression of NOS2, C1qa, and IL1a in 3-month old TREM2+/- vs. TREM2+/+ mice. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of a single copy of trem2 had no effect on Abeta pathology, but altered the morphological phenotype of plaque-associated microglia.

However, a new orientation of the amyloid cascade hypothesis has evidenced that soluble forms of the peptide (sAbeta) are involved in Abeta-induced cognitive impairment and cause rapid disruption of the synaptic mechanisms underlying memory. The primary aim of this study was to elucidate the effects of sAbeta, acutely injected intracerebrally (i.c.v., 4 muM), on the short term and long term memory of young adult male rats, by using the novel object recognition task. Glutamatergic receptors have been proposed as mediating the effect of Abeta on synaptic plasticity and memory. Thus, we also investigated the effects of sAbeta on prefrontal cortex (PFC) glutamate release and the specific contribution of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor modulation to the effects of sAbeta administration on the cognitive parameters evaluated. We found that a single i.c.v. injection of sAbeta 2 h before testing did not alter the ability of rats to differentiate between a familiar and a novel object, in a short term memory test, while it was able to negatively affect consolidation/retrieval of long term memory. Moreover, a significant increase of glutamate levels was found in PFC of rats treated with the peptide 2 h earlier. Interestingly, memory deficit induced by sAbeta was reversed by a NMDA-receptor antagonist, memantine (5 mg/kg i.p), administered immediately after the familiarization trial (T1). On the contrary, memantine administered 30 min before T1 trial, was not able to rescue long term memory impairment.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether measured CSF biomarker concentrations were affected by transfer of CSF between tubes, and whether addition of a non-ionic surfactant mitigates any observed effects. METHODS: AD and control CSF was transferred consecutively between polypropylene tubes. Abeta peptides and T-tau were measured with and without addition of Tween 20 (0.05%). RESULTS: Measured concentrations of Abeta42 decreased by approximately 25% with each consecutive transfer. Measured concentrations of Abeta38 and Abeta40 were also observed to decrease significantly with each consecutive transfer (approximately 16% loss per transfer). Measured concentrations of T-tau also decreased significantly, but at much smaller magnitude than the Abeta peptides (approximately 4% loss per transfer). The addition of Tween 20 mitigated this effect in all samples. CONCLUSIONS: Consecutive CSF transfer between tubes has a significant impact on the measured concentration of all Abeta peptides, and significant effect of lesser magnitude on T-tau.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to AD pathogenesis remains largely unknown. Previously, our transcriptome sequence analyses revealed global expressional modifications of over 600 genes in APP-Swedish mutant-expressing H4 (H4-sw) cells compared to wild type H4 cells. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) is one gene that showed significantly decreased mRNA expression in H4-sw cells. In this study, we investigated the functional role of IGFBP3 in AD pathogenesis and elucidated the mechanisms regulating its expression. We observed decreased IGFBP3 expression in the H4-sw cell line as well as the hippocampus of AD model transgenic mice. Treatment with exogenous IGFBP3 protein inhibited Abeta1-42- induced cell death and caspase-3 activity, whereas siRNA-mediated suppression of IGFBP3 expression induced cell death and caspase-3 cleavage. In primary hippocampal neurons, administration of IGFBP3 protein blocked apoptotic cell death due to Abeta1-42 toxicity. These data implicate a protective role for IGFBP3 against Abeta1-42-mediated apoptosis. Next, we investigated the regulatory mechanisms of IGFBP3 expression in AD pathogenesis. We observed abnormal IGFBP3 hypermethylation within the promoter CpG island in H4-sw cells. Treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored IGFBP3 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Chronic exposure to Abeta1-42 induced IGFBP3 hypermethylation at CpGs, particularly at loci -164 and -173, and subsequently suppressed IGFBP3 expression. Therefore, we demonstrate that expression of anti-apoptotic IGFBP3 is regulated by epigenetic DNA methylation, suggesting a mechanism that contributes to AD pathogenesis.\", '']\n",

Substantial evidence has indicated that the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening is involved in Abeta-induced neuronal death and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), one of the major active constituents of Astragalus membranaceus, has been reported as an effective anti-oxidant for treating neurodegenerative diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms still need to be clarified. In this study, we investigated whether AS-IV could prevent Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity in SK-N-SH cells via inhibiting the mPTP opening. The results showed that pretreatment of AS-IV significantly increased the viability of neuronal cells, reduced apoptosis, decreased the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased mitochondrial superoxide in the presence of Abeta1-42. In addition, pretreatment of AS-IV inhibited the mPTP opening, rescued mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), enhanced ATP generation, improved the activity of cytochrome c oxidase and blocked cytochrome c release from mitochondria in Abeta1-42 rich milieu. Moreover, pretreatment of AS-IV reduced the expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 and increased the expression of Bcl-2 in an Abeta1-42 rich environment.

In addition, it is estimated that almost half of all AD patients have significant cerebrovascular disease comorbid with their AD pathology. We hypothesized that cerebrovascular disease significantly impacts AD pathological progression. METHODS: We used a dietary model of cerebrovascular disease that relies on the induction of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy). HHcy is a significant clinical risk factor for stroke, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. In the present study, we induced HHcy in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. RESULTS: While total beta-amyloid (Abeta) load is unchanged across groups, Congophilic amyloid deposition was decreased in the parenchyma and significantly increased in the vasculature as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA; vascular amyloid deposition) in HHcy APP/PS1 mice. We also found that HHcy induced more microhemorrhages in the APP/PS1 mice than in the wild-type mice and that it switched the neuroinflammatory phenotype from an M2a biased state to an M1 biased state. Associated with these changes was an induction of the matrix metalloproteinase protein 2 (MMP2) and MMP9 systems. Interestingly, after 6 months of HHcy, the APP/PS1 mice were cognitively worse than wild-type HHcy mice or APP/PS1 mice, indicative of an additive effect of the cerebrovascular pathology and amyloid deposition. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that cerebrovascular disease can significantly impact Abeta distribution in the brain, favoring vascular deposition.

Dissimilarities and similarities between humans and rodents are discussed in an attempt to generate a current understanding of microglial pathology and its significance during aging and in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer dementia (AD). The identification of dystrophic (senescent) microglia has created an ostensible conflict with prior work claiming a role for activated microglia and neuroinflammation during normal aging and in AD, and this has raised a basic question: does the brain's immune system become hyperactive (inflamed) or does it become weakened (senescent) in elderly and demented people, and what is the impact on neuronal function and cognition? Here we strive to reconcile these seemingly contradictory notions by arguing that both low-grade neuroinflammation and microglial senescence are the result of aging-associated free radical injury. Both processes are damaging for microglia as they synergistically exhaust this essential cell population to the point where the brain's immune system is effete and unable to support neuronal function.\", '']\n",

Although studies of post-mortem brain tissue provide clues of etiology, the physiological function of Hirano bodies remains unknown. A cell culture model was utilized to study the interactions of mutant tau proteins, model Hirano bodies, and GSK3beta in human astrocytoma cells. RESULTS: Most tau variants showed co-localization with model Hirano bodies. Cosedimentation assays revealed this interaction may be direct, as recombinant purified forms of tau are all capable of binding F-actin. Model Hirano bodies had no effect or enhanced cell death induced by tau in the absence of amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain (AICD). In the presence of AICD and tau, synergistic cell death was observed in most cases, and model Hirano bodies decreased this synergistic cell death, except for forms of tau that caused significant cell death in the presence of Hirano bodies only. A role for the kinase GSK3beta is suggested by the finding that a dominant negative form of GSK3beta reduces this synergistic cell death. A subset of Hirano bodies in brain tissue of both Alzheimer's disease and normal aged individuals was found to contain tau, with some Hirano bodies in Alzheimer's disease brains containing hyperphosphorylated tau.

Previously, we developed an adult-onset Drosophila model of AD. Mutant Abeta42 accumulation led to increased mortality and neuronal dysfunction in the adult flies. Furthermore, we showed that lithium reduced Abeta42 protein, but not mRNA, and was able to rescue Abeta42-induced toxicity. In the current study, we investigated the mechanism/s by which lithium modulates Abeta42 protein levels and Abeta42 induced toxicity in the fly model. We found that lithium caused a reduction in protein synthesis in Drosophila and hence the level of Abeta42. At both the low and high doses tested, lithium rescued the locomotory defects induced by Abeta42, but it rescued lifespan only at lower doses, suggesting that long-term, high-dose lithium treatment may have induced toxicity.

This study investigated whether Australian adults recognise this as an important health issue, and hold beliefs and knowledge that are consistent with recommendations concerning dementia risk reduction. This research was undertaken to guide national brain health awareness and education strategies. METHODS: A cross-sectional telephone survey was undertaken of 1,003 Australians aged 20-75 years. This measured the importance placed on dementia, beliefs and confidence related to risk reduction, knowledge of risk reduction methods, and the perceived age-relevance of these. In analysis the data were stratified by sex, age, educational attainment, household income, language preference and previous exposure to dementia. Multivariable logistic regression was undertaken to identify variables independently associated with beliefs and knowledge. RESULTS: People aged 60 years and over identified dementia as very important (17.2%) more often than those aged 40-59 years (5.1%) or 20-39 years (2.1%). While 41.5% of respondents believed the risk of dementia could be reduced, 26.9% were very confident that they could achieve this. Mental activity (57.1%) was identified as beneficial much more often than physical activity (31.3%), healthy eating (23.3%) and other cardiovascular health behaviours. Women, people of English-speaking origin, and those having contact with a person with dementia, showed better knowledge of several health behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: Growing attention is being given to population risk reduction to combat the dramatic increase in the burden of disease due to dementia. In Australia many people do not yet hold beliefs and knowledge that support this, which highlights the need for concerted awareness raising that dementia is not an inevitable aspect of ageing, and for education about the role of vascular health in dementia risk reduction.\", '']\n",

Abeta peptides are targeted to cholesterol-rich membrane micro-domains called lipid rafts. Observations that many raft proteins undertake recycling pathways that avoid the lysosomes suggest that the accumulation of Abeta in neurons may be related to Abeta targeting lipid rafts. Here we tested the hypothesis that the degradation of Abeta by neurons could be increased by drugs affecting raft formation. METHODS: Primary neurons were incubated with soluble Abeta preparations. The amounts of Abeta42 in neurons or specific cellular compartments were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effects of drugs on the degradation of Abeta42 were studied. RESULTS: Abeta42 was targeted to detergent-resistant, low-density membranes (lipid rafts), trafficked via a pathway that avoided the lysosomes, and was slowly degraded by neurons (half-life was greater than 5 days). The metabolism of Abeta42 was sensitive to pharmacological manipulation. In neurons treated with the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor squalestatin, less Abeta42 was found within rafts, greater amounts of Abeta42 were found in lysosomes, and the half-life of Abeta42 was reduced to less than 24 hours. Treatment with phospholipase A2 inhibitors or platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonists had the same effects on Abeta42 metabolism in neurons as squalestatin. PAF receptors were concentrated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) along with enzymes that constitute the cholesterol ester cycle. The addition of PAF to ER membranes triggered activation of cholesterol ester hydrolases and the release of cholesterol from stores of cholesterol esters. An inhibitor of cholesterol ester hydrolases (diethylumbelliferyl phosphate) also increased the degradation of Abeta42 in neurons. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the targeting of Abeta42 to rafts in normal cells is a factor that affects its degradation. Critically, pharmacological manipulation of neurons can significantly increase Abeta42 degradation. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the Abeta-induced production of PAF controls a cholesterol-sensitive pathway that affects the cellular localization and hence the fate of Abeta42 in neurons.\", '']\n",

At this stage, the parasite as well as the vector undergoes immense oxidative stress. Thereafter, the vector undergoes oxidative stress at different time points as the parasite invades its tissues during the parasite development. The present study was undertaken to reconstruct the network of differentially expressed genes involved in oxidative stress in Anopheles stephensi during Plasmodium development and maturation in the midgut. Using high throughput next generation sequencing methods, we generated the transcriptome of the An. stephensi midgut during Plasmodium vinckei petteri oocyst invasion of the midgut epithelium. Further, we utilized large datasets available on public domain on Anopheles during Plasmodium ookinete invasion and Drosophila datasets and arrived upon clusters of genes that may play a role in oxidative stress. Finally, we used support vector machines for the functional prediction of the un-annotated genes of An. stephensi. Integrating the results from all the different data analyses, we identified a total of 516 genes that were involved in oxidative stress in An. stephensi during Plasmodium development. The significantly regulated genes were further extracted from this gene cluster and used to infer an oxidative stress network of An. stephensi.

While individual Abeta-accumulation can be measured non-invasively using Pittsburgh Compund-B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET), Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) is a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequence, capable of indicating heterogeneous age-related brain pathologies associated with tissue-edema. In the current study cognitively normal elderly subjects were investigated for regional correlation of PiB- and FLAIR intensity. METHODS: Fourteen healthy elderly subjects without known history of cognitive impairment received 11C-PiB-PET for estimation of regional Abeta-load. In addition, whole brain T1-MPRAGE and FLAIR-MRI sequences were acquired at high field strength of 7 Tesla (7T). Volume-normalized intensities of brain regions were assessed by applying an automated subcortical segmentation algorithm for spatial definition of brain structures. Statistical dependence between FLAIR- and PiB-PET intensities was tested using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rho), followed by Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. RESULTS: Neuropsychological testing revealed normal cognitive performance levels in all participants. Mean regional PiB-PET and FLAIR intensities were normally distributed and independent. Significant correlation between volume-normalized PiB-PET signals and FLAIR intensities resulted for Hippocampus (right: rho = 0.86; left: rho = 0.84), Brainstem (rho = 0.85) and left Basal Ganglia vessel region (rho = 0.82). CONCLUSIONS: Our finding of a significant relationship between PiB- and FLAIR intensity mainly observable in the Hippocampus and Brainstem, indicates regional Abeta associated tissue-edema in cognitively normal elderly subjects.

The major neuropathological lesions in AD are accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) as amyloid plaques and congophilic amyloid angiopathy, as well as aggregated tau in the form of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). In addition, inflammation and microglia/macrophage function play an important role in AD pathogenesis. We have hypothesized that stimulation of the innate immune system via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists, such as type B CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), might be an effective way to ameliorate AD related pathology. We have previously shown in the Tg2576 AD model that CpG ODN can reduce amyloid deposition and prevent cognitive deficits. In the present study, we used the 3xTg-AD mice with both Abeta and tau related pathology. The mice were divided into 2 groups treated from 7 to 20 months of age, prior to onset of pathology and from 11 to 18 months of age, when pathology is already present. We demonstrated that immunomodulatory treatment with CpG ODN reduces both Abeta and tau pathologies, as well as levels of toxic oligomers, in the absence of any apparent inflammatory toxicity, in both animal groups. This pathology reduction is associated with a cognitive rescue in the 3xTg-AD mice. Our data indicate that modulation of microglial function via TLR9 stimulation is effective at ameliorating all the cardinal AD related pathologies in an AD mouse model suggesting such an approach would have a greater chance of achieving clinical efficacy.\", '']\n",

However, the mechanisms by which diabetes modifies cognitive function still remains unclear. Morphologically, diabetes is associated with neuronal loss in the frontal and temporal lobes including the hippocampus, and aberrant functional connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex and medial frontal/temporal gyrus. Clinically, diabetic patients show decreased executive function, information processing, planning, visuospatial construction, and visual memory. Therefore, in comparison with the characteristics of AD brain structure and cognition, diabetes seems to affect cognitive function through not only simple AD pathological feature-dependent mechanisms but also independent mechanisms. As an Abeta/tau-independent mechanism, diabetes compromises cerebrovascular function, increases subcortical infarction, and might alter the blood-brain barrier. Diabetes also affects glucose metabolism, insulin signaling, and mitochondrial function in the brain. Diabetes also modifies metabolism of Abeta and tau and causes Abeta/tau-dependent pathological changes. Moreover, there is evidence that suggests an interaction between Abeta/tau-dependent and independent mechanisms. Therefore, diabetes modifies cognitive function through Abeta/tau-dependent and independent mechanisms. Interaction between these two mechanisms forms a vicious cycle.', '']\n",

R., et al.;2014;\", \"beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) initiates the production of beta-amyloid (Abeta), the major constituent of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). BACE1 is elevated approximately 2-3 fold in AD brain and is concentrated in dystrophic neurites near plaques, suggesting BACE1 elevation is Abeta-dependent. Previously, we showed that phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha de-represses translation of BACE1 mRNA following stress such as energy deprivation. We hypothesized that stress induced by Abeta might increase BACE1 levels by the same translational mechanism involving eIF2alpha phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we used three different genetic strategies to determine the effects of reducing eIF2alpha phosphorylation on Abeta-dependent BACE1 elevation in vitro and in vivo: 1) a two-vector adeno-associated virus (AAV) system to express constitutively active GADD34, the regulatory subunit of PP1c eIF2alpha phosphatase; 2) a non-phosphorylatable eIF2alpha S51A knockin mutation; 3) a BACE1-YFP transgene lacking the BACE1 mRNA 5' untranslated region (UTR) required for eIF2alpha translational regulation. The first two strategies were used in primary neurons and 5XFAD transgenic mice, while the third strategy was employed only in 5XFAD mice. Despite very effective reduction of eIF2alpha phosphorylation in both primary neurons and 5XFAD brains, or elimination of eIF2alpha-mediated regulation of BACE1-YFP mRNA translation in 5XFAD brains, Abeta-dependent BACE1 elevation was not decreased. Additionally, robust inhibition of eIF2alpha phosphorylation did not block Abeta-dependent APP elevation in primary neurons, nor did it reduce amyloid pathology in 5XFAD mice. We conclude that amyloid-associated BACE1 elevation is not caused by translational de-repression via eIF2alpha phosphorylation, but instead appears to involve a post-translational mechanism. These definitive genetic results exclude a role for eIF2alpha phosphorylation in Abeta-dependent BACE1 and APP elevation. We suggest a vicious pathogenic cycle wherein Abeta42 toxicity induces peri-plaque BACE1 and APP accumulation in dystrophic neurites leading to exacerbated Abeta production and plaque progression.\", '']\n",

Despite child survival and safe motherhood programmes towards reducing child mortality, insufficient attention has been given to this critical first month of life. There is urgent need to innovatively employ alternative solutions that take into account the intricate complexities of neonatal health and the health systems. In this paper, we set out to empirically contribute to understanding the causes of the stagnating neonatal mortality by applying a systems thinking approach to explore the dynamics arising from the neonatal health complexity and non-linearity and its interplay with health systems factors, using Uganda as a case study. METHODS: Literature reviews and interviews were conducted in two divisions of Kampala district with high neonatal mortality rates with mothers at antenatal clinics and at home, village health workers, community leaders, healthcare decision and policy makers, and frontline health workers from both public and private health facilities. Data analysis and brainstorming sessions were used to develop causal loop diagrams (CLDs) depicting the causes of neonatal mortality, which were validated by local and international stakeholders. RESULTS: We developed two CLDs for demand and supply side issues, depicting the range of factors associated with neonatal mortality such as maternal health, level of awareness of maternal and newborn health, and availability and quality of health services, among others. Further, the reinforcing and balancing feedback loops that resulted from this complexity were also examined. The potential high leverage points include special gender considerations to ensure that girls receive essential education, thereby increasing maternal literacy rates, improved socioeconomic status enabling mothers to keep healthy and utilise health services, improved supervision, and internal audits at the health facilities as well as addressing the gaps in resources (human, logistics, and drugs).

Accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) in the brain is influenced by APOE genotype. Transgenic mice co-expressing five familial AD mutations (5xFAD) in the presence of human APOE alleles (2, 3 or 4) exhibit APOE genotype-specific differences in early Abeta accumulation, suggesting an interaction between APOE and AD pathology. Whether APOE genotype affects Abeta-plaque-associated neuroinflammation remains unclear. In the current study, we address the role of APOE genotype on Abeta-associated microglial reactivity in the EFAD transgenic mouse model. METHODS: We analyzed Abeta-induced glial activation in the brains of 6-month-old EFAD transgenic mice (E2FAD, E3FAD and E4FAD). Region-specific morphological profiles of Abeta plaques in EFAD brain sections were compared using immunofluorescence staining. We then determined the degree of glial activation in sites of Abeta deposition while comparing levels of the inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) by ELISA. Finally, we quantified parameters of Abeta-associated microglial reactivity using double-stained EFAD brain sections. RESULTS: Characterization of Abeta plaques revealed there were larger and more intensely stained plaques in E4FAD mice relative to E2FAD and E3FAD mice. E4FAD mice also had a greater percentage of compact plaques in the subiculum than E3FAD mice. Reactive microglia and dystrophic astrocytes were prominent in EFAD brains, and primarily localized to two sites of significant Abeta deposition: the subiculum and deep layers of the cortex. Cortical levels of IL-1beta were nearly twofold greater in E4FAD mice relative to E3FAD mice. To control for differences in levels of Abeta in the different EFAD mice, we analyzed the microglia within domains of specific Abeta deposits. Morphometric analyses revealed increased measures of microglial reactivity in E4FAD mice, including greater dystrophy, increased fluorescence intensity and a higher density of reactive cells surrounding cortical plaques, than in E3FAD mice. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to altering morphological profiles of Abeta deposition, APOE genotype influences Abeta-induced glial activation in the adult EFAD cortex. These data support a role for APOE in modulating Abeta-induced neuroinflammatory responses in AD progression, and support the use of EFAD mice as a suitable model for mechanistic studies of Abeta-associated neuroinflammation.\", '']\n",

A., et al.;2014;', 'ATHB17 (AT2G01430) is an Arabidopsis gene encoding a member of the alpha-subclass of the homeodomain leucine zipper class II (HD-Zip II) family of transcription factors. The ATHB17 monomer contains four domains common to all class II HD-Zip proteins: a putative repression domain adjacent to a homeodomain, leucine zipper, and carboxy terminal domain. However, it also possesses a unique N-terminus not present in other members of the family. In this study we demonstrate that the unique 73 amino acid N-terminus is involved in regulation of cellular localization of ATHB17. The ATHB17 protein is shown to function as a transcriptional repressor and an EAR-like motif is identified within the putative repression domain of ATHB17. Transformation of maize with an ATHB17 expression construct leads to the expression of ATHB17Delta113, a truncated protein lacking the first 113 amino acids which encodes a significant portion of the repression domain. Because ATHB17Delta113 lacks the repression domain, the protein cannot directly affect the transcription of its target genes. ATHB17Delta113 can homodimerize, form heterodimers with maize endogenous HD-Zip II proteins, and bind to target DNA sequences; thus, ATHB17Delta113 may interfere with HD-Zip II mediated transcriptional activity via a dominant negative mechanism. We provide evidence that maize HD-Zip II proteins function as transcriptional repressors and that ATHB17Delta113 relieves this HD-Zip II mediated transcriptional repression activity. Expression of ATHB17Delta113 in maize leads to increased ear size at silking and, therefore, may enhance sink potential.

M., et al.;2014;\", \"Some cognitively healthy individuals develop brain amyloid accumulation, suggestive of incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the effect of amyloid on other potentially informative imaging modalities, such as Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), in characterizing brain changes in preclinical AD requires further exploration. In this study, a sample (N = 139, mean age 60.6, range 46 to 71) from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP), a cohort enriched for AD risk factors, was recruited for a multimodal imaging investigation that included DTI and [C-11]Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET). Participants were grouped as amyloid positive (Abeta+), amyloid indeterminate (Abetai), or amyloid negative (Abeta-) based on the amount and pattern of amyloid deposition. Regional voxel-wise analyses of four DTI metrics, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (Da), and radial diffusivity (Dr), were performed based on amyloid grouping. Three regions of interest (ROIs), the cingulum adjacent to the corpus callosum, hippocampal cingulum, and lateral fornix, were selected based on their involvement in the early stages of AD. Voxel-wise analysis revealed higher FA among Abeta+ compared to Abeta- in all three ROIs and in Abetai compared to Abeta- in the cingulum adjacent to the corpus callosum. Follow-up exploratory whole-brain analyses were consistent with the ROI findings, revealing multiple regions where higher FA was associated with greater amyloid. Lower fronto-lateral gray matter MD was associated with higher amyloid burden. Further investigation showed a negative correlation between MD and PiB signal, suggesting that Abeta accumulation impairs diffusion. Interestingly, these findings in a largely presymptomatic sample are in contradistinction to relationships reported in the literature in symptomatic disease stages of Mild Cognitive Impairment and AD, which usually show higher MD and lower FA. Together with analyses showing that cognitive function in these participants is not associated with any of the four DTI metrics, the present results suggest an early relationship between PiB and DTI, which may be a meaningful indicator of the initiating or compensatory mechanisms of AD prior to cognitive decline.\", '']\n",

Among those, the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the beta amyloid peptide (Abeta) are largely associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the regulation and potential contribution of MMPs to AD remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the evolution of the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and membrane-type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP) in the hippocampus at different stages of the pathology (asymptomatic, prodromal-like and symptomatic) in the 5xFAD transgenic mouse AD model. In parallel we also followed the expression of functionally associated factors. Overall, the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and MT1-MMP was upregulated concomitantly with the tissue inhibitor of MMPs-1 (TIMP-1) and several markers of inflammatory/glial response. The three MMPs exhibited age- and cell-dependent upregulation of their expression, with MMP-2 and MMP-9 being primarily located to astrocytes, and MT1-MMP to neurons. MMP-9 and MT1-MMP were also prominently present in amyloid plaques. The levels of active MT1-MMP were highly upregulated in membrane-enriched fractions of hippocampus at 6 months of age (symptomatic phase), when the levels of APP, its metabolites APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs), and Abeta trimers were the highest. Overexpression of MT1-MMP in HEK cells carrying the human APP Swedish mutation (HEKswe) strongly increased beta-secretase derived C-terminal APP fragment (C99) and Abeta levels, whereas MMP-2 overexpression nearly abolished Abeta production without affecting C99. Our data consolidate the emerging idea of a regulatory interplay between MMPs and the APP/Abeta system, and demonstrate for the first time the pro-amyloidogenic features of MT1-MMP. Further investigation will be justified to evaluate this MMP as a novel potential therapeutic target in AD.\", '']\n",

A COS is an agreed minimum set of outcomes that should be measured and reported in all clinical trials of a specific disease or trial population. The overall aim of the Core Outcome Measurement Instrument Selection (COMIS) project is to develop a guideline on how to select outcome measurement instruments for outcomes included in a COS. As part of this project, we describe our current efforts to achieve a consensus on the methods for selecting outcome measurement instruments for outcomes to be included in a COS. METHODS/DESIGN: A Delphi study is being performed by a panel of international experts representing diverse stakeholders with the intention that this will result in a guideline for outcome measurement instrument selection. Informed by a literature review, a Delphi questionnaire was developed to identify potentially relevant tasks on instrument selection. The Delphi study takes place in a series of rounds. In the first round, panelists were asked to rate the importance of different tasks in the selection of outcome measurement instruments. They were encouraged to justify their choices and to add other relevant tasks. Consensus was reached if at least 70% of the panelists considered a task 'highly recommended' or 'desirable' and if no opposing arguments were provided. These tasks will be included in the guideline. Tasks that at least 50% of the panelists considered 'not relevant' will be excluded from the guideline. Tasks that were indeterminate will be taken to the second round. All responses of the first round are currently being aggregated and will be fed back to panelists in the second round. A third round will only be performed if the results of the second round require it. DISCUSSION: Since the Delphi method allows a large group of international experts to participate, we consider it to be the preferred consensus-based method for our study.

A., et al.;2014;\", 'BACKGROUND: Mounting evidence suggests that soluble oligomers of amyloid-beta (oAbeta) represent the pertinent synaptotoxic form of Abeta in sporadic Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD); however, the mechanistic links between oAbeta and synaptic degeneration remain elusive. Most in vivo experiments to date have been limited to examining the toxicity of oAbeta in mouse models that also possess insoluble fibrillar Abeta (fAbeta), and data generated from these models can lead to ambiguous interpretations. Our goal in the present study was to examine the effects of soluble oAbeta on neuronal and synaptic structure in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) E693Q (\"Dutch\") mouse model of AD, which develops intraneuronal accumulation of soluble oAbeta with no detectable plaques in AD-relevant brain regions. We performed quantitative analyses of neuronal pathology, including dendrite morphology, spine density, and synapse ultrastructure in individual hippocampal CA1 neurons. RESULTS: When assessing neuronal morphology and complexity we observed significant alterations in apical but not in basal dendritic arbor length in Dutch mice compared to wild type. Moreover, Dutch mice exhibited a significant decrease in dendritic arborization with a decrease in dendritic length and number of intersections at 120 mum and 150 mum from the soma, respectively. We next examined synaptic parameters and found that while there were no differences in overall synaptic structure, Dutch mice displayed a significant reduction in the post-synaptic density (PSD) length of synapses on mushroom spines, in comparison to wild type littermates. CONCLUSION: The structural alterations to individual neurons in Dutch mice along with the changes in larger dendritic spines support the Abeta oligomer hypothesis, which postulates that the early cognitive impairments that occur in AD are attributed to the accumulation of soluble oAbeta first affecting at the synaptic level with subsequent structural disturbances and cellular degeneration.', '']\n",

Thus, BACE1 is a key target for candidate disease-modifying treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In a previous exploratory Abeta biomarker study, we found that BACE1 inhibitor treatment resulted in decreased levels of Abeta1-34 together with increased Abeta5-40, suggesting that these Abeta species may be novel pharmacodynamic biomarkers in clinical trials. We have now examined whether the same holds true in humans. METHODS: In an investigator-blind, placebo-controlled and randomized study, healthy subjects (n =18) were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of 30 mg of LY2811376 (n =6), 90 mg of LY2811376 (n =6), or placebo (n =6). We used hybrid immunoaffinity-mass spectrometry (HI-MS) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to monitor a variety of Abeta peptides. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate dose-dependent changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta1-34, Abeta5-40 and Abeta5-X after treatment with the BACE1-inhibitor LY2811376. Abeta5-40 and Abeta5-X increased dose-dependently, as reflected by two independent methods, while Abeta1-34 dose-dependently decreased. CONCLUSION: Using HI-MS for the first time in a study where subjects have been treated with a BACE inhibitor, we confirm that CSF Abeta1-34 may be useful in clinical trials on BACE1 inhibitors to monitor target engagement. Since it is less hydrophobic than longer Abeta species, it is less susceptible to preanalytical confounding factors and may thus be a more stable marker. By independent measurement techniques, we also show that BACE1 inhibition in humans is associated with APP-processing into N-terminally truncated Abeta peptides via a BACE1-independent pathway.

DATA SOURCE: Secondary data analysis of 2001-2010 Medicare claims for 1,776,387 person years assigned to the ten participating provider organizations and 1,579,080 person years in the corresponding local comparison groups. STUDY DESIGN: We used a pre-post comparison group observational design consisting of four pre-demonstration years (1/01-12/04) and five demonstration years (4/05-3/10). We employed a propensity-weighted difference-in-differences regression model to estimate demonstration effects, adjusting for demographics, health status, geographic area, and secular trends. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The ten demonstration sites combined saved $171 (2.0%) per assigned beneficiary person year (p<0.001) during the five-year demonstration period. Medicare paid performance bonuses to the participating PGPs that averaged $102 per person year. The net savings to the Medicare program were $69 (0.8%) per person year. Demonstration savings were achieved primarily from the inpatient setting. The demonstration improved quality of care as measured by six of seven claims-based process quality indicators. CONCLUSIONS: The PGP demonstration, which used a payment model similar to the Medicare Accountable Care Organization (ACO) program, resulted in small reductions in Medicare expenditures and inpatient utilization, and improvements in process quality indicators. Judging from this demonstration experience, it is unlikely that Medicare ACOs will initially achieve large savings. Nevertheless, ACOs paid through shared savings may be an important first step toward greater efficiency and quality in the Medicare fee-for-service program.', '']\n",

Alzheimer's disease is characterized immunohistologically by the accumulation of senile plaques in the brain with afflicted patients progressively losing short-term memory and, ultimately, cognition. Although significant improvements in clinical diagnosis and care for AD patients have been made, effective treatments for this devastating disease remain elusive. A key component of the amyloid burden of AD comes from accumulation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide which comes from processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by enzymes termed secretases, leading to production of these toxic Abeta peptides of 40-42 amino acids. New therapeutic approaches for reducing Abeta are warranted after the most logical avenues of inhibiting secretase activity appear less than optimal in ameliorating the progression of AD.Novel therapeutics may be gleaned from proteomics biomarker initiatives to yield detailed molecular interactions of enzymes and their potential substrates. Explicating the APPome by deciphering protein complexes forming in cells is a complementary approach to unveil novel molecular interactions with the amyloidogenic peptide precursor to both understand the biology and develop potential upstream drug targets. Utilizing these strategies we have identified EC 3.4.24.15 (EP24.15), a zinc metalloprotease related to neprilysin (NEP), with the ability to catabolize Abeta 1-42 by examining first potential in silico docking and then verification by mass spectrometry. In addition, a hormone carrier protein, transthyreitin (TTR), was identified and with its abundance in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), found to clear Abeta by inhibiting formation of oligomeric forms of Abeta peptide. The confluence of complementary strategies may allow new therapeutic avenues as well as biomarkers for AD that will aid in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.\", '']\n",

However, it remains elusive whether the apoE2 isoform exerts truly protective effect against Abeta pathology or apoE2 plays deleterious role albeit less pronounced than the apoE4 isoform. Here, we characterized APPSW/PS1dE9/APOE epsilon2-TR (APP/E2) and APPSW/PS1dE9/APOE epsilon4-TR (APP/E4) mice, with targeted replacement (TR) of the murine Apoe for human epsilon2 or epsilon4 alleles, and used these models to investigate effects of pharmacological inhibition of the apoE/Abeta interaction on Abeta deposition and neuritic degeneration. APP/E2 and APP/E4 mice replicate differential effect of human apoE isoforms on Abeta pathology with APP/E4 mice showing a several-fold greater load of Abeta plaques, insoluble brain Abeta levels, Abeta oligomers, and density of neuritic plaques than APP/E2 mice. Furthermore, APP/E4 mice, but not APP/E2 mice, exhibit memory impairment on object recognition and radial arm maze tests. Between the age of 6 and 10 months APP/E2 and APP/E4 mice received treatment with Abeta12-28P, a non-toxic, synthetic peptide homologous to the apoE binding motif within the Abeta sequence, which competitively blocks the apoE/Abeta interaction. In both lines, the treatment significantly reduced brain Abeta accumulation, co-accumulation of apoE within Abeta plaques, and neuritic degeneration, and prevented memory deficit in APP/E4 mice.

The aims of this study were to explore whether mRNA-levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gnrh) and its receptor (Gnrhr) were changed in plaque-bearing Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice and to investigate whether these levels and amyloid plaque deposition were downregulated by treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (Gnrh-a; Leuprorelin acetate). The study was performed on mice carrying the Arctic and Swedish amyloid-beta precursor protein (AbetaPP) mutations (tgArcSwe). At 12 months of age, female tgArcSwe mice showed a twofold higher level of Gnrh mRNA and more than 1.5 higher level of Gnrhr mRNA than age matched controls. Male tgArcSwe mice showed the same pattern of changes, albeit more pronounced. In both sexes, Gnrh-a treatment caused significant down-regulation of Gnrh and Gnrhr mRNA expression. Immunohistochemistry combined with quantitative image analysis revealed no significant changes in the plaque load after Gnrh-a treatment in hippocampus and thalamus. However, plaque load in the cerebral cortex of treated females tended to be lower than in female vehicle-treated mice. The present study points to the involvement of hormonal changes in AD mice models and demonstrates that these changes can be effectively counteracted by pharmacological treatment. Although known to increase in normal aging, our study shows that Gnrh/Gnrhr mRNA expression increases much more dramatically in tgArcSwe mice. Treatment with Leuprorelin acetate successfully abolished the transgene specific effects on Gnrh/Gnrhr mRNA expression. The present experimental approach should serve as a platform for further studies on the usefulness of Gnrh-a treatment in suppressing plaque development in AD.\", '']\n",

Recent evidences suggest that non-fibrillary Abeta forms bind to membrane receptors and modulate GSK-3beta activity, which in turn phosphorylates the microtubule-associated tau protein leading to axonal disruption and toxic accumulation. Available AD animal models, ranging from rodent to invertebrates, significantly contributed to our current knowledge, but complementary platforms for mechanistic and candidate drug screenings remain critical for the identification of early stage biomarkers and potential disease-modifying therapies. Here we show that Abeta1-42 injection in the hindbrain ventricle of 24 hpf zebrafish embryos results in specific cognitive deficits and increased tau phosphorylation in GSK-3beta target residues at 5dpf larvae. These effects are reversed by lithium incubation and not accompanied by apoptotic markers. We believe this may represent a straightforward platform useful to identification of cellular and molecular mechanisms of early stage AD-like symptoms and the effects of neuroactive molecules in pharmacological screenings.\", '']\n",

We note several unresolved issues in the field including the presence of Abeta deposition in cognitively normal individuals, the weak correlation between plaque load and cognition, questions regarding the biochemical nature, presence and role of Abeta oligomeric assemblies in vivo, the bias of pre-clinical AD models toward the amyloid hypothesis and the poorly explained pathological heterogeneity and comorbidities associated with AD. We also illustrate how extensive data cited in support of the amyloid hypothesis, including genetic links to disease, can be interpreted independently of a role for Abeta in AD.

Several Abeta-degrading enzymes, including neprilysin (NEP), endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) reduce Abeta levels and protect against cognitive impairment in mouse models of AD. In post-mortem human brain tissue we have found that the activity of these Abeta-degrading enzymes rise with age and increases still further in AD, perhaps as a physiological response that helps to minimize the build-up of Abeta. ECE-1/-2 and ACE are also rate-limiting enzymes in the production of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and angiotensin II (Ang II), two potent vasoconstrictors, increases in the levels of which are likely to contribute to reduced blood flow in AD. This review considers the possible interdependence between Abeta-degrading enzymes, ischemia and Abeta in AD: ischemia has been shown to increase Abeta production both in vitro and in vivo, whereas increased Abeta probably enhances ischemia by vasoconstriction, mediated at least in part by increased ECE and ACE activity. In contrast, NEP activity may help to maintain cerebral perfusion, by reducing the accumulation of Abeta in cerebral blood vessels and lessening its toxicity to vascular smooth muscle cells. In assessing the role of Abeta-degrading proteases in the pathogenesis of AD and, particularly, their potential as therapeutic agents, it is important to bear in mind the multifunctional nature of these enzymes and to consider their effects on other substrates and pathways.', '']\n",

Here we investigated the neuroprotective function of the soluble APP ectodomain sAPPalpha (soluble APPalpha), which is generated by cleavage of APP by alpha-secretase along the non-amyloidogenic pathway. Recombinant sAPPalpha protected primary hippocampal neurons and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells from cell death induced by trophic factor deprivation. We show that this protective effect is abrogated in neurons from APP-knockout animals and APP-depleted SH-SY5Y cells, but not in APP-like protein 1- and 2- (APLP1 and APLP2) depleted cells, indicating that expression of membrane-bound holo-APP is required for sAPPalpha-dependent neuroprotection. Trophic factor deprivation diminished the activity of the Akt survival pathway. Strikingly, both recombinant sAPPalpha and the APP-E1 domain were able to stimulate Akt activity in wild-type (wt) fibroblasts, SH-SY5Y cells and neurons, but failed to rescue in APP-deficient neurons or fibroblasts. The ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10) inhibitor GI254023X exacerbated neuron death in organotypic (hippocampal) slice cultures of wt mice subjected to trophic factor and glucose deprivation. This cell death-enhancing effect of GI254023X could be completely rescued by applying exogenous sAPPalpha. Interestingly, sAPPalpha-dependent Akt induction was unaffected in neurons of APP-DeltaCT15 mice that lack the C-terminal YENPTY motif of the APP intracellular region. In contrast, sAPPalpha-dependent rescue of Akt activation was completely abolished in APP mutant cells lacking the G-protein interaction motif located in the APP C-terminus and by blocking G-protein-dependent signaling with pertussis toxin. Collectively, our data provide new mechanistic insights into the physiologic role of APP in antagonizing neurotoxic stress: they suggest that cell surface APP mediates sAPPalpha-induced neuroprotection via G-protein-coupled activation of the Akt pathway.', '']\n",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between IADL and regional cortical thinning and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers cross-sectionally and longitudinally in clinically normal (CN) elderly, MCI, and mild AD dementia subjects. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty nine CN, 395 MCI, and 188 AD dementia subjects participating in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative underwent baseline magnetic resonance imaging, baseline lumbar puncture, and clinical assessments, including the Functional Activities Questionnaire used to measure IADL, every 6 to 12 months up to 3 years. General linear regression and mixed effects models were employed. RESULTS: IADL impairment was associated with the interactions between lower inferior temporal cortical thickness and diagnosis (p < 0.0001), greater lateral occipital cortical thickness and diagnosis (p < 0.0001), and greater amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42) and diagnosis (p = 0.0002) at baseline (driven by AD dementia). Lower baseline supramarginal (p = 0.02) and inferior temporal (p = 0.05) cortical thickness, lower Abeta1-42 (p < 0.0001), and greater total tau (t-tau) (p = 0.02) were associated with greater rate of IADL impairment over time. CONCLUSIONS: Temporal atrophy is associated with IADL impairment in mild AD dementia at baseline, while baseline parietal and temporal atrophy, lower CSF Abeta1-42, and greater t-tau predict worsening IADL impairment over time across the AD spectrum.

Hyper-phosphorylation of Tau reduces its binding to microtubules and it is associated with beta-amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease.

The current studies investigated the role of Tau in autophagic and proteasomal intracellular Abeta1-42 clearance and the subsequent effect on plaque deposition. RESULTS: Tau deletion impaired Abeta clearance via autophagy, but not the proteasome, while introduction of wild type human Tau into Tau-/- mice partially restored autophagic clearance of Abeta1-42, suggesting that exogenous Tau expression can support autophagic Abeta1-42 clearance. Tau deletion impaired autophagic flux and resulted in Abeta1-42 accumulation in pre-lysosomal autophagic vacuoles, affecting Abeta1-42 deposition into the lysosome. This autophagic defect was associated with decreased intracellular Abeta1-42 and increased plaque load in Tau-/- mice, which displayed less cell death.

The present study focuses on the in vitro protective effect of pinocembrin on fibrillar Abeta(1-40) (fAbeta(1-40)) injured human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs) and explores potential mechanisms. The results demonstrate that fAbeta(1-40)-induced cytotoxicity in hBMECs can be rescued by pinocembrin treatment.

The mechanisms of this reversal from Abeta may be associated with the inhibition of inflammatory response, involving inhibition of MAPK activation, downregulation of phosphor-IKK level, relief of IkappaBalpha degradation, blockage of NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation, and reduction of the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Pinocembrin does not show obvious effects on regulating the redox imbalance after exposure to fAbeta(1-40).

      "['4295427;25491510;Amyloid-beta precursor protein promotes cell proliferation and motility of advanced breast cancer;Lim, S., et al.;2014;', 'BACKGROUND: Amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) is a highly conserved single transmembrane protein that has been linked to Alzheimer disease. Recently, the increased expression of APP in multiple types of cancers has been reported where it has significant correlation with the cancer cell proliferation. However, the function of APP in the pathogenesis of breast cancer has not previously been determined. In this study, we studied the pathological role of APP in breast cancer and revealed its potential mechanism. METHODS: The expression level of APP in multiple breast cancer cell lines was measured by Western blot analysis and the breast cancer tissue microarray was utilized to analyze the expression pattern of APP in human patient specimens. To interrogate the functional role of APP in cell growth and apoptosis, the effect of APP knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells were analyzed. Specifically, multiple signal transduction pathways and functional alterations linked to cell survival and motility were examined in in vivo animal model as well as in vitro cell culture with the manipulation of APP expression. RESULTS: We found that the expression of APP is increased in mouse and human breast cancer cell lines, especially in the cell line possessing higher metastatic potential. Moreover, the analysis of human breast cancer tissues revealed a significant correlation between the level of APP and tumor development. Knockdown of APP (APP-kd) in breast cancer cells caused the retardation of cell growth in vitro and in vivo, with both the induction of p27(kip1) and caspase-3-mediated apoptosis. APP-kd cells also had higher sensitivity to treatment of chemotherapeutic agents, TRAIL and 5-FU. Such anti-tumorigenic effects shown in the APP-kd cells partially came from reduced pro-survival AKT activation in response to IGF-1, leading to activation of key signaling regulators for cell growth, survival, and pro-apoptotic events such as GSK3-beta and FOXO1. Notably, knock-down of APP in metastatic breast cancer cells limited cell migration and invasion ability upon stimulation of IGF-1. CONCLUSION: The present data strongly suggest that the increase of APP expression is causally linked to tumorigenicity as well as invasion of aggressive breast cancer and, therefore, the targeting of APP may be an effective therapy for breast cancer.', '']\n",

An imbalance between Abeta production and clearance from the brain may contribute to accumulation of neurotoxic Abeta and subsequent synaptic loss, which is the strongest correlate of the extent of memory loss in AD. The activity of neprilysin (NEP), a potent Abeta-degrading enzyme, is decreased in the AD brain. Expression of HuD, an mRNA-binding protein important for synaptogenesis and neuronal plasticity, is also decreased in the AD brain. HuD is regulated by protein kinase Cepsilon (PKCepsilon), and we previously demonstrated that PKCepsilon activation decreases Abeta levels. We hypothesized that PKCepsilon acts through HuD to stabilize NEP mRNA, modulate its localization, and support NEP activity. Conversely, loss of PKCepsilon-activated HuD in AD leads to decreased NEP activity and accumulation of Abeta. Here we show that HuD is associated with NEP mRNA in cultures of human SK-N-SH cells. Treatment with bryostatin, a PKCepsilon-selective activator, enhanced NEP association with HuD and increased NEP mRNA stability. Activation of PKCepsilon also increased NEP protein levels, increased NEP phosphorylation, and induced cell surface expression. In addition, specific PKCepsilon activation directly stimulated NEP activity, leading to degradation of a monomeric form of Abeta peptide and decreased Abeta neuronal toxicity, as measured by cell viability. Bryostatin treatment also rescued Abeta-mediated inhibition of HuD-NEP mRNA binding, NEP protein expression, and NEP cell membrane translocation. These results suggest that PKCepsilon activation reduces Abeta by up-regulating, via the mRNA-binding protein HuD, Abeta-degrading enzymes such as NEP. Thus, PKCepsilon activation may have therapeutic efficacy for AD by reducing neurotoxic Abeta accumulation as well as having direct anti-apoptotic and synaptogenic effects.\", '']\n",

Besides the parenchymal pathology, Abeta is known to undergo active transport across the blood-brain barrier and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a prominent feature in the majority of AD. Although impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF) has been implicated in faulty Abeta transport and clearance, and cerebral hypoperfusion can exist in the pre-clinical phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is still unclear whether it is one of the causal factors for AD pathogenesis, or an early consequence of a multi-factor condition that would lead to AD at late stage. To study the potential interaction between faulty CBF and amyloid accumulation in clinical-relevant situation, we generated a new amyloid precursor protein (APP) knock-in allele that expresses humanized Abeta and a Dutch mutation in addition to Swedish/London mutations and compared this line with an equivalent knock-in line but in the absence of the Dutch mutation, both crossed onto the PS1M146V knock-in background. RESULTS: Introduction of the Dutch mutation results in robust CAA and parenchymal Abeta pathology, age-dependent reduction of spatial learning and memory deficits, and CBF reduction as detected by fMRI. Direct manipulation of CBF by transverse aortic constriction surgery on the left common carotid artery caused differential changes in CBF in the anterior and middle region of the cortex, where it is reduced on the left side and increased on the right side. However these perturbations in CBF resulted in the same effect: both significantly exacerbate CAA and amyloid pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a direct and positive link between vascular and parenchymal Abeta; both can be modulated by CBF.

If a statistically significant effect is seen in the primary outcome, CDR-sb will be considered to be a coprimary end point and only the DAD will contribute to the secondary outcome analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study and all subsequent amendments have received ethical approval within each participating country according to national regulations. Each participant will provide written consent to participate in the study. All participants will remain anonymised throughout and the results of the study will be published in an international peer-reviewed journal.

F., et al.;2014;', \"Increasing lines of evidence support that testosterone may have neuroprotective effects. While observational studies reported an association between higher bioavailable testosterone or brain testosterone levels and reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is limited understanding of the underlying neuroprotective mechanisms. Previous studies demonstrated that testosterone could alleviate neurotoxicity induced by beta-amyloid (Abeta), but these findings mainly focused on neuronal apoptosis. Since synaptic dysfunction and degeneration are early events during the pathogenesis of AD, we aim to investigate the effects of testosterone on oligomeric Abeta-induced synaptic changes. Our data suggested that exposure of primary cultured hippocampal neurons to oligomeric Abeta could reduce the length of neurites and decrease the expression of presynaptic proteins including synaptophysin, synaptotagmin, and synapsin-1. Abeta also disrupted synaptic vesicle recycling and protein folding machinery. Testosterone preserved the integrity of neurites and the expression of presynaptic proteins. It also attenuated Abeta-induced impairment of synaptic exocytosis. By using letrozole as an aromatase antagonist, we further demonstrated that the effects of testosterone on exocytosis were unlikely to be mediated through the estrogen receptor pathway. Furthermore, we showed that testosterone could attenuate Abeta-induced reduction of HSP70, which suggests a novel mechanism that links testosterone and its protective function on Abeta-induced synaptic damage. Taken together, our data provide further evidence on the beneficial effects of testosterone, which may be useful for future drug development for AD.\", '']\n",

The type of drug that has developed most rapidly in the last decade is immunotherapy: vaccines and, especially, passive vaccination with monoclonal antibodies. Antibodies are attractive drugs as they can be made highly specific for their target and often with few side effects. Data from recent clinical AD trials indicate that a treatment effect by immunotherapy is possible, providing hope for a new generation of drugs. The first anti-amyloid-beta (anti-Abeta) vaccine developed by Elan, AN1792, was halted in phase 2 because of aseptic meningoencephalitis. However, in a follow-up study, patients with antibody response to the vaccine demonstrated reduced cognitive decline, supporting the hypothesis that Abeta immunotherapy may have clinically relevant effects. Bapineuzumab (Elan/Pfizer Inc./Johnson & Johnson), a monoclonal antibody targeting fibrillar Abeta, was stopped because the desired clinical effect was not seen. Solanezumab (Eli Lilly and Company) was developed to target soluble, monomeric Abeta. In two phase 3 studies, Solanezumab did not meet primary endpoints. When data from the two studies were pooled, a positive pattern emerged, revealing a significant slowing of cognitive decline in the subgroup of mild AD. The Arctic mutation has been shown to specifically increase the formation of soluble Abeta protofibrils, an Abeta species shown to be toxic to neurons and likely to be present in all cases of AD. A monoclonal antibody, mAb158, was developed to target Abeta protofibrils with high selectivity. It has at least a 1,000-fold higher selectivity for protofibrils as compared with monomers of Abeta, thus targeting the toxic species of the peptide. A humanized version of mAb158, BAN2401, has now entered a clinical phase 2b trial in a collaboration between BioArctic Neuroscience and Eisai without the safety concerns seen in previous phase 1 and 2a trials. Experiences from the field indicate the importance of initiating treatment early in the course of the disease and of enriching the trial population by improving the diagnostic accuracy. BAN2401 is a promising candidate for Abeta immunotherapy in early AD. Other encouraging efforts in immunotherapy as well as in the small-molecule field offer hope for new innovative therapies for AD in the future.\", '']\n",

However, there is paucity of data on potential neuroprotective effects of ASH against beta-Amyloid (1-42) (Abeta) induced neuropathogenesis. In the present study, we have tested the neuroprotective effects of Methanol: Chloroform (3:1) extract of ASH and its constituent Withanolide A (WA) against Abeta induced toxicity, HIV-1Ba-L (clade B) infection and the effects of drugs of abuse using a human neuronal SK-N-MC cell line. Abeta when tested individually, induced cytotoxic effects in SK-N-MC cells as shown by increased trypan blue stained cells. However, when ASH was added to Abeta treated cells the toxic effects were neutralized. This observation was supported by cellular localization of Abeta, MTT formazan exocytosis, and the levels of acetylcholinesterase activity, confirming the chemopreventive or protective effects of ASH against Abeta induced toxicity. Further, the levels of MAP2 were significantly increased in cells infected with HIV-1Ba-L (clade B) as well as in cells treated with Cocaine (COC) and Methamphetamine (METH) compared with control cells. In ASH treated cells the MAP2 levels were significantly less compared to controls. Similar results were observed in combination experiments. Also, WA, a purified constituent of ASH, showed same pattern using MTT assay as a parameter. These results suggests that neuroprotective properties of ASH observed in the present study may provide some explanation for the ethnopharmacological uses of ASH in traditional medicine for cognitive and other HIV associated neurodegenerative disorders and further ASH could be a potential novel drug to reduce the brain amyloid burden and/or improve the HIV-1 associated neurocognitive impairments.\", '']\n",

The low-molecular weight oligomers of Abeta aggregates (2 to 30 mers) are known to be the primary neurotoxic agents whose mechanisms of cellular toxicity and synaptic dysfunction have received substantial attention in the recent years. However, how these toxic agents proliferate and induce widespread amyloid deposition throughout the brain, and what mechanism is involved in the amplification and propagation of toxic oligomer species, are far from clear. Emerging evidence based on transgenic mice models indicates a transmissible nature of Abeta aggregates and implicates a prion-like mechanism of oligomer propagation, which manifests as the dissemination and proliferation of Abeta toxicity. Despite accumulating evidence in support of a transmissible nature of Abeta aggregates, a clear, molecular-level understanding of this intriguing mechanism is lacking. Recently, we reported the characterization of unique replicating oligomers of Abeta42 (12-24 mers) in vitro called Large Fatty Acid-derived Oligomers (LFAOs) (Kumar et al., 2012, J. Biol. Chem). In the current report, we establish that LFAOs possess physiological activity by activating NF-kappaB in human neuroblastoma cells, and determine the experimental parameters that control the efficiency of LFAO replication by self-propagation.

A column cleaning procedure involved gradual removal of aqueous solvents by acetonitrile assured consistent long-term chromatography performance. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve and correlation analyses evaluated the diagnostic utility of UPLC-MS-MS compared to AlzBio3 immunoassay for detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The surrogate matrix, artificial CSF containing 4 mg/mL of BSA, provides linear and reproducible calibration comparable to human pooled CSF as calibration matrix. Appropriate cleaning of the trapping and analytical columns provided every-day, trouble-free runs. Analyses of CSF Abeta42 showed that UPLC-MS-MS distinguished neuropathologically-diagnosed AD subjects from healthy controls with at least equivalent diagnostic utility to AlzBio3. Comparison of ROC curves for these two assays showed no statistically significant difference (p = 0.2229). Linear regression analysis of Abeta42 concentrations measured by this mass spectrometry-based method compared to the AlzBio3 immunoassay showed significantly higher but highly correlated results.

Both homocysteine (Hcy) and amyloid beta (Abeta), which accumulates in the brain of AD patients, bind copper. Aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the association of Hcy and AD results from a molecular interaction between Hcy and Abeta that is mediated by copper. We established a microtiter plate format thioflavin T aggregation assay to monitor Abeta42 fibrillization. Copper (5 muM) completely prevented Abeta42 (5 muM) fibrillization. Homocysteine in the absence of copper did not impact Abeta42 fibrillization, but physiological concentrations of Hcy (10-100 muM) attenuated the inhibitory effect of copper on Abeta42 fibril formation. These results were qualitatively confirmed by electron microscopy, which did not reveal morphological differences. To compare the toxicity of fibrillar and non-fibrillar Abeta42 exposed to copper or Hcy, rat primary cortical neurons were treated in vitro with 5 muM Abeta42 for 72 h. After incubation with 5 muM Abeta42 that had been aggregating in the absence of Hcy or copper, cell viability was reduced to 40%. Incubation with 5 muM Abeta42, in which fibril formation had been prevented or reverted by the addition of 5 muM copper, resulted in cell viability of approximately 25%. Accordingly, viability was reduced to 25% after incubation with 5 muM monomeric, i.e., non-fibrillized, Abeta42. The addition of Hcy plus copper to 5 muM Abeta42 yielded 50% viability. In conclusion, copper prevents and reverts Abeta fibril formation leading rather to formation of lower order oligomers or amorphous aggregates, and Hcy reduces these effects.

Perturbation in Abeta clearance, rather than Abeta production, is likely the cause of sporadic, late-onset AD, which accounts for the majority of AD cases. Since cellular uptake and subsequent degradation constitute a major Abeta clearance pathway, the receptor-mediated endocytosis of Abeta has been intensely investigated. Among Abeta receptors, the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is one of the most studied receptors. LRP1 is a large endocytic receptor for more than 40 ligands, including apolipoprotein E, alpha2-macroglobulin and Abeta. Emerging in vitro and in vivo evidence demonstrates that LRP1 is critically involved in brain Abeta clearance. LRP1 is highly expressed in a variety of cell types in the brain including neurons, vascular cells and glial cells, where LRP1 functions to maintain brain homeostasis and control Abeta metabolism. LRP1-mediated endocytosis regulates cellular Abeta uptake by binding to Abeta either directly or indirectly through its co-receptors or ligands. Furthermore, LRP1 regulates several signaling pathways, which also likely influences Abeta endocytic pathways. In this review, we discuss how LRP1 regulates the brain Abeta clearance and how this unique endocytic receptor participates in AD pathogenesis. Understanding of the mechanisms underlying LRP1-mediated Abeta clearance should enable the rational design of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for AD.\", '']\n",

Previous research on risk factors for AD typically utilizes statistical comparison tests or stepwise selection with regression models. Outcomes of these methods tend to emphasize single risk factors rather than a combination of risk factors. However, a combination of factors, rather than any one alone, is likely to affect disease development. Genetic algorithms (GA) can be useful and efficient for searching a combination of variables for the best achievement (eg. accuracy of diagnosis), especially when the search space is large, complex or poorly understood, as in the case in prediction of AD development. RESULTS: Multiple sets of neuropsychological tests were identified by GA to best predict conversions between clinical categories, with a cross validated AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 0.90 for prediction of HC conversion to MCI/AD and 0.86 for MCI conversion to AD within 36 months. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the potential of GA application in the neural science area.

This study is a questionnaire survey on the use of pharmacological agents to modify liver ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury in patients undergoing hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases with the target population being those units participating in the LiverMetSurvey international registry. Methods. Members of LiverMetSurvey were sent an online questionnaire using SurveyMonkey comprising ten questions on the use of pharmacological agents to modulate hepatic IR injury in the perioperative period after hepatectomy. The questionnaire was sent to 446 clinicians registered with the LiverMetSurvey. There were 83 (19%) respondents. Results. Fifty-two (77% of 68 respondents to this question) never used pharmacological agents to modify liver IR injury during hepatectomy. Thirteen (19%) used pharmacological agents selectively. Three (4%) used these routinely. N-Acetylcysteine was the most widely used pharmacological agent with equal distribution of use around intraoperative and postoperative periods. Conclusions. This is believed to be the first survey on the use of pharmacological agents to modify liver IR injury. The target population is clinicians involved in liver resection.

Synaptic binding of Abeta oligomers to several putative receptor proteins is reported to inhibit long-term potentiation, affect membrane trafficking and induce reversible spine loss in neurons, leading to impaired cognitive performance and ultimately to anterograde amnesia in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have identified a receptor not previously associated with AD that mediates the binding of Abeta oligomers to neurons, and describe novel therapeutic antagonists of this receptor capable of blocking Abeta toxic effects on synapses in vitro and cognitive deficits in vivo. Knockdown of sigma-2/PGRMC1 (progesterone receptor membrane component 1) protein expression in vitro using siRNA results in a highly correlated reduction in binding of exogenous Abeta oligomers to neurons of more than 90%. Expression of sigma-2/PGRMC1 is upregulated in vitro by treatment with Abeta oligomers, and is dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease patients' brain compared to age-matched, normal individuals. Specific, high affinity small molecule receptor antagonists and antibodies raised against specific regions on this receptor can displace synthetic Abeta oligomer binding to synaptic puncta in vitro and displace endogenous human AD patient oligomers from brain tissue sections in a dose-dependent manner. These receptor antagonists prevent and reverse the effects of Abeta oligomers on membrane trafficking and synapse loss in vitro and cognitive deficits in AD mouse models. These findings suggest sigma-2/PGRMC1 receptors mediate saturable oligomer binding to synaptic puncta on neurons and that brain penetrant, small molecules can displace endogenous and synthetic oligomers and improve cognitive deficits in AD models. We propose that sigma-2/PGRMC1 is a key mediator of the pathological effects of Abeta oligomers in AD and is a tractable target for small molecule disease-modifying therapeutics.\", '']\n",

Alterations in membrane trafficking induced by Abeta oligomers mediates reduction in neuronal surface receptor expression that is the basis for inhibition of electrophysiological measures of synaptic plasticity and thus learning and memory. We have utilized phenotypic screens in mature, in vitro cultures of rat brain cells to identify small molecules which block or prevent the binding and effects of Abeta oligomers. Synthetic Abeta oligomers bind saturably to a single site on neuronal synapses and induce deficits in membrane trafficking in neuronal cultures with an EC50 that corresponds to its binding affinity. The therapeutic lead compounds we have found are pharmacological antagonists of Abeta oligomers, reducing the binding of Abeta oligomers to neurons in vitro, preventing spine loss in neurons and preventing and treating oligomer-induced deficits in membrane trafficking. These molecules are highly brain penetrant and prevent and restore cognitive deficits in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. Counter-screening these compounds against a broad panel of potential CNS targets revealed they are highly potent and specific ligands of the sigma-2/PGRMC1 receptor. Brain concentrations of the compounds corresponding to greater than 80% receptor occupancy at the sigma-2/PGRMC1 receptor restore cognitive function in transgenic hAPP Swe/Ldn mice. These studies demonstrate that synthetic and human-derived Abeta oligomers act as pharmacologically-behaved ligands at neuronal receptors--i.e. they exhibit saturable binding to a target, they exert a functional effect related to their binding and their displacement by small molecule antagonists blocks their functional effect.

In this study, we investigated for the first time the anti-neuroinflammatory effects and possible mechanisms of SCM-198 (an alkaloid extracted from Herbaleonuri), which was previously found highly cardioprotective, both in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: For in vitro experiments, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or beta-amyloid(1-40) (Abeta(1-40)) was applied to induce microglial overactivation. Proinflammatory mediators were measured and activations of NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinases' (MAPKs) pathways were investigated. Further protective effect of SCM-198 was evaluated in microglia-neuron co-culture assay and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats intrahippocampally-injected with Abeta(1-40). RESULTS: SCM-198 reduced expressions of nitric oxide (NO), TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 possibly via, at least partially, inhibiting c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and NF-kappaB signaling pathways in microglia. Co-culture assay showed that activated microglia pretreated with SCM-198 led to less neuron loss and decreased phosphorylation of tau and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in neurons. Besides, SCM-198 also directly protected against Abeta(1-40)-induced neuronal death and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in primary cortical neurons. For in vivo studies, SCM-198 significantly enhanced cognitive performances of rats 12 days after intrahippocampal injections of aged Abeta(1-40) peptides in the Morris water maze (MWM), accompanied by less hippocampal microglial activation, decreased synaptophysin loss and phosphorylation of ERK and tau. Co-administration of donepezil and SCM-198 resulted in a slight cognitive improvement in SD rats 50 days after intrahippocampal injections of aged Abeta(1-40) peptides as compared to only donepezil or SCM-198 treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are the first to report that SCM-198 has considerable anti-neuroinflammatory effects on inhibiting microglial overactivation and might become a new potential drug candidate for AD therapy in the future.\", '']\n",

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratio for coronary heart disease and stroke associated with the ADH1B variant in all individuals and by categories of alcohol consumption. RESULTS: Carriers of the A-allele of ADH1B rs1229984 consumed 17.2% fewer units of alcohol per week (95% confidence interval 15.6% to 18.9%), had a lower prevalence of binge drinking (odds ratio 0.78 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.84)), and had higher abstention (odds ratio 1.27 (1.21 to 1.34)) than non-carriers.

Since Egr1 is an immediate early gene involved in memory formation, we wondered whether other early genes involved in memory were regulated by APP and we studied molecular mechanisms involved. By comparing prefrontal (PF) cortex from wild type (APP+/+) and APP knockout mice (APP-/-), we observed that APP down regulates expression of four immediate early genes, Egr1, c-Fos, Bdnf and Arc. Down regulation of Egr1, c-Fos and Bdnf transcription resulted from a decreased enrichment of acetylated histone H4 on the corresponding gene promoter. Further characterization of H4 acetylation at Egr1 and c-Fos promoters revealed increased acetylation of H4K5 and H4K12 residues in APP-/- mice. Whereas APP affected Egr1 promoter activity by reducing access of the CREB transcription factor, its effect on c-Fos appeared to depend on increased recruitment of HDAC2 histone deacetylase to the gene promoter. The physiological relevance of the epigenetic regulation of Egr1 and c-Fos gene transcription by APP was further analyzed following exposure of mice to novelty. Although transcription of Egr1 and c-Fos was increased following exposure of APP+/+ mice to novelty, such an induction was not possible in APP-/- mice with a high basal level of expression of these immediate early genes.

Both total and oligomeric alpha-synuclein levels were evaluated by using well-established immunoassays. RESULTS: The levels of alpha-synuclein oligomers in the CSF were increased in patients with PDD compared with the controls (P < 0.05), but not in patients with DLB compared with controls.

Rather, amyloid-beta misfolding may follow a variety of pathways resulting in a fibrillar end-product or a variety of oligomeric end-products with a diversity of structures and sizes. The presence of metal ions has been demonstrated to alter the kinetic pathway of the amyloid-beta peptide which may lead to more toxic oligomeric end-products.

Moreover, both Abeta oligomer formation and Abeta plaque number are reduced in APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice lacking mGluR5 expression. In addition to the observed increase in Abeta oligomers and plaques in APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice, we found that both mTOR phosphorylation and fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) expression were increased in these mice. Genetic deletion of mGluR5 reduced Abeta oligomers, plaques, mTOR phosphorylation and FMRP expression in APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice.

Although sequencing is the gold standard of the genotypic resistance testing (GRT), high-throughput GRT targeted to the codons responsible for DR may be more appropriate for epidemiological studies and public health research. METHODS: We used a Japanese database to design and synthesize sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (SSOP) for the detection of wild-type sequences and 6 DR mutations in the clade B HIV-1 reverse transcriptase region. We coupled SSOP to microbeads of the Luminex 100 xMAP system and developed a GRT based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-SSOP-Luminex method. RESULTS: Sixteen oligoprobes for discriminating DR mutations from wild-type sequences at 6 loci were designed and synthesized, and their sensitivity and specificity were confirmed using isogenic plasmids. The PCR-SSOP-Luminex DR assay was then compared to direct sequencing using 74 plasma specimens from treatment-naive patients or those on failing treatment. In the majority of specimens, the results of the PCR-SSOP-Luminex DR assay were concordant with sequencing results: 62/74 (83.8%) for M41, 43/74 (58.1%) for K65, 70/74 (94.6%) for K70, 55/73 (75.3%) for K103, 63/73 (86.3%) for M184 and 68/73 (93.2%) for T215. There were a number of specimens without any positive signals, especially for K65. The nucleotide position of A2723G, A2747G and C2750T were frequent polymorphisms for the wild-type amino acids K65, K66 and D67, respectively, and 14 specimens had the D67N mutation encoded by G2748A. We synthesized 14 additional oligoprobes for K65, and the sensitivity for K65 loci improved from 43/74 (58.1%) to 68/74 (91.9%). CONCLUSIONS: We developed a rapid high-throughput assay for clade B HIV-1 DR mutations, which could be customized by synthesizing oligoprobes suitable for the circulating viruses.

Several studies have shown that N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptors (NMDAR) activation is involved in the detrimental actions of Abeta. Polyamines, like spermidine and spermine, are positive modulators of NMDAR function and it has been shown that their levels are regulated by Abeta. In this study we show here that interruption of NMDAR modulation by polyamines through blockade of its binding site at NMDAR by arcaine (0.02 nmol/site), or inhibition of polyamine synthesis by DFMO (2.7 nmol/site), reverses Abeta25-35-induced memory impairment in mice in a novel object recognition task. Incubation of hippocampal cell cultures with Abeta25-35 (10 microM) significantly increased the nuclear accumulation of Jacob, which is a hallmark of NMDAR activation. The Abeta-induced nuclear translocation of Jacob was blocked upon application of traxoprodil (4 nM), arcaine (4 microM) or DFMO (5 microM), suggesting that activation of the polyamine binding site at NMDAR located probably at extrasynaptic sites might underlie the cognitive deficits of Abeta25-35-treated mice. Extrasynaptic NMDAR activation in primary neurons results in a stripping of synaptic contacts and simplification of neuronal cytoarchitecture. Abeta25-35 application in hippocampal primary cell cultures reduced dendritic spine density and induced alterations on spine morphology. Application of traxoprodil (4 nM), arcaine (4 microM) or DFMO (5 microM) reversed these effects of Abeta25-35.

We propose that rather than causing damage because of the action of free radicals, oxidative stress deranges signaling pathways leading to tau hyperphosphorylation, a hallmark of the disease. Indeed, incubation of neurons in culture with 5 microM beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) causes an activation of p38 MAPK (p38) that leads to tau hyperphosphorylation. Inhibition of p38 prevents Abeta-induced tau phosphorylation. Abeta-induced effects are prevented when neurons are co-incubated with trolox (the water-soluble analog of vitamin E). We have confirmed these results in vivo, in APP/PS1 double transgenic mice of AD. We have found that APP/PS1 transgenic mice exhibit a high level of P-p38 in the hippocampus but not in cortex and this is prevented by feeding animals with a diet supplemented with vitamin E.

We explored this hypothesis using world-wide breast cancer incidence data. METHODS: We compared international age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) of pre- (<50 years) and postmenopausal (>/=50 years) breast cancers as well as temporal trends in ASRs of pre-and postmenopausal breast cancer among selected countries during 1975-2008. We used joinpoint log-linear regression analysis to estimate annual percent changes (APC) for premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer in the northern Europe and in Black and White women population in the US. RESULTS: Premenopausal breast cancers comprised a substantially higher proportion of all incident breast cancers in LDCs (average 47.3%) compared to MDCs (average 18.5%). However, the ASR of premenopausal breast cancer was consistently higher in MDCs (29.4/100,000) than LDCs (12.8/100,000). The ASR of postmenopausal cancer was about five-fold higher in the MDCs (307.6/100,000) than the LDCs (65.4/100,000). The APC of breast cancer in Denmark was substantially higher in postmenopausal (1.33%) than premenopausal cancer (0.98%). Higher incidence of breast cancer among the white than black women in the US was pertained only to the postmenopausal cancer. CONCLUSION: The substantial and consistent lower age-specific incidence of breast cancer in LDCs than in MDCs contradicts the theory of earlier onset.

The characterization of the behavioral phenotypes in this animal model could provide a baseline of efficacy for earlier therapeutic interventions.

In parallel, we measured Abeta by ELISA, Western blots and semiquantitative immunohistochemistry in hippocampal samples. SDS-soluble Abeta peptide accumulated at low levels (~9 pg/mg) without differences among ages. However, Western blots showed SDS-resistant Abeta oligomers (~30 kDa) at 6 and 12 months, but not at 3 months.

Alongside the recent description of the impairment of lysosomal acidification, we wanted to study the relationships between inflammation and autophagy, two physiological components deregulated in AD. Therefore, a longitudinal study was performed in APPswePS1dE9 transgenic mice at three, six and twelve months of age. METHODS: Autophagic markers (Beclin-1, p62 and LC3) and the activation of mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway were quantified by western blot. Cytokine levels (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IL-6) were measured by ELISA. Transmission electron microscopy was performed to detect autophagic vacuoles. Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare wild-type (WT) versus APPswePS1dE9 mice. Longitudinal changes in parameters were analyzed with a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a post-hoc Dunn's test. Correlation between two parameters was assessed using a Spearman test. RESULTS: Compared to 12-month old WT mice, 12-month old APPswePS1dE9 mice had higher levels of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, a greater inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway and lower levels of Beclin-1 expression both in cortex and hippocampus. Regarding the relationship of the various parameters in 12-month old APPswePS1dE9 mice, Beclin-1 rates were positively correlated with IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels. And, on the contrary, TNF-alpha levels were inversely correlated with the levels of mTOR activation. Altogether, these results suggest that inflammation could induce autophagy in APPswePS1dE9 mice. However, these transgenic mice displayed a large accumulation of autophagic vesicles within dystrophic neurons in cortex and hippocampus, indicating a terminal failure in the autophagic process.

Expression of PSEDN components in cnidarians is consistent with function in sensory organ development. Recent work in demosponges demonstrated the presence of single homologs of Pax and Six genes, and their possible involvement in morphogenesis, but the absence of the remaining network components. Calcisponges are evolutionarily distant from demosponges, and the developmental toolkits of these two lineages differ significantly. We used an emerging model system, Sycon ciliatum, to identify components of the PSEDN and study their expression during embryonic and postembryonic development. RESULTS: We identified two Pax, three Six and one Eya genes in calcisponges, a situation strikingly different than in the previously studied demosponges. One of the calcisponge Pax genes can be identified as PaxB, while the second Pax gene has no clear affiliation. The three calcisponge Six genes could not be confidently classified within any known family of Six genes. Expression analysis in adult S. ciliatum demonstrated that representatives of Pax, Six and Eya are expressed in patterns consistent with roles in morphogenesis of the choanocyte chambers. Distinct paralogues of Pax and Six genes were expressed early in the development of the putative larval sensory cells, the cruciform cells. While lack of known photo pigments in calcisponge genomes precludes formal assignment of function to the cruciform cells, we also show that they express additional eumetazoan genes involved in specification of sensory and neuronal cells: Elav and Msi. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the role of a Pax-Six-Eya network in morphogenesis likely predates the animal divergence. In addition, Pax and Six, as well as Elav and Msi are expressed during differentiation of cruciform cells, which are good candidates for being sensory cells of the calcaronean sponge larvae.', '']\n",

In addition to AD, tau imaging with PET may also be of value in assessing non-AD tauopathies, such as corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Pick's disease (PiD). METHODS: To further investigate the ability of THK523 to recognize tau lesions, we undertook immunohistochemical and fluorescence studies in serial brain sections taken from individuals with AD (n = 3), CBD (n = 2), PSP (n = 1), PiD (n = 2) and Parkinson's disease (PD; n = 2). In addition to the neuropathological analysis, one PSP patient had undergone a (18)F-THK523 PET scan 5 months before death. RESULTS: Although THK523 labelled tau-containing lesions such as neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads in the hippocampus and frontal regions of AD brains, it failed to label tau-containing lesions in non-AD tauopathies.

In contrast, this study used a late-onset AD model to examine the interaction between increased dietary zinc (Zn) and the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene. ApoE epsilon4 is overrepresented in late-onset AD and enhances Zn binding to amyloid-beta (Abeta). This study sought to determine if elevated dietary Zn would impair spatial memory in CRND8 mice (CRND8), as well as mice who carry both the mutated human amyloid precursor protein (APP) and ApoE epsilon4 genes (CRND8/E4). Mice were provided with either lab tap water or water enhanced with 10 ppm Zn (ZnCO3) for 4 months. At 6 months of age, spatial memory was measured by the Barnes maze. CRND8 mice exhibited significant memory deficits compared to WT mice, as shown by an increased latency to reach the escape box. For the CRND8/E4, but not the CRND8 mice, those given Zn water made significantly more errors than those on lab water. During the probe trial for the WT group, those on Zn water spent significantly less time in the target quadrant than those on lab water. These data suggest that increased dietary Zn can significantly impair spatial memory in CRND8/E4. WT mice given Zn water were also impaired on the 24-h probe trial when compared to lab water WTs. Within the CRND8/E4 group only, levels of soluble Abeta were significantly correlated with average primary latencies. Within the Zn-treated CRND8/E4 group, there was a significant correlation between insoluble Abeta and average primary errors. Levels of the zinc transporter 3, ZnT3, were negatively correlated with soluble Abeta (p < 0.01). These findings are particularly relevant because increased intake of dietary supplements, such as Zn, are common in the elderly-a population already at risk for AD. Given the effects observed in the CRND8/E4 mice, ApoE status should be taken into consideration when evaluating the efficacy of therapies targeting metals.\", '']\n",

Among the hypotheses being investigated for impact on clinical outcome are the preferred epitope or conformation of amyloid-beta to target for treatment, and the mechanism of action underlying immunotherapy. Bapineuzumab (humanized 3D6), a neo-epitope specific antibody recognizing amyloid-beta1-5 with strong preference for an exposed Asp residue at the N-terminus of the peptide, has undergone advanced clinical testing for treatment of AD. METHODS: To gain further insight into the epitope conformation, we interrogated structural details of amino-terminal epitopes in amyloid-beta using x-ray crystallography of 3D6Fab:amyloid-beta complexes. Humanization of 3D6 was carried out using standard procedures integrating recombinant methods, sequence informatics, and homology modeling predictions to identify important mouse framework residues for retention in the finished humanized product. RESULTS: Here we report the crystal structure of a recombinant Fab fragment of 3D6 in complex with amyloid-beta1-7 solved at 2.0 A resolution. The N-terminus of amyloid-beta is bound to 3D6 as a 310 helix. The amino-terminal Asp residue is buried deepest in the antibody binding pocket, with the Cbeta atom of residue 6 visible at the entrance to the binding pocket near the surface of the antibody. We further evaluate homology model based predictions used to guide humanization of 3D6 to bapineuzumab, with actual structure of the Fab. The structure of the Fab:amyloid-beta complex validates design of the humanized antibody, and confirms the amyloid-beta epitope recognized by 3D6 as previously mapped by ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: The conformation of amyloid-beta antigen recognized by 3D6 is novel and distinct from other antibodies recognizing N-terminal epitopes. Our result provides the first report demonstrating structural conservation of antigen contact residues, and conformation of antigen recognized, between the parent murine antibody and its humanized version.\", '']\n",

Here, we investigated DNA methylation changes associated with melanoma progression and links between methylation patterns and other types of somatic alterations, including the most frequent mutations and DNA copy number changes. Our results revealed that the methylome, presenting in early stage samples and associated with the BRAF(V600E) mutation, gradually decreased in the medium and late stages of the disease. An inverse relationship among the other predefined groups and promoter methylation was also revealed except for histologic subtype, whereas the more aggressive, nodular subtype melanomas exhibited hypermethylation as well. The Breslow thickness, which is a continuous variable, allowed for the most precise insight into how promoter methylation decreases from stage to stage. Integrating our methylation results with a high-throughput copy number alteration dataset, local correlations were detected in the MYB and EYA4 genes. With regard to the effects of DNA hypermethylation on melanoma patients' survival, correcting for clinical cofounders, only the KIT gene was associated with a lower overall survival rate. In this study, we demonstrate the strong influence of promoter localized DNA methylation changes on melanoma initiation and show how hypermethylation decreases in melanomas associated with less favourable clinical outcomes.

Nevertheless, recent studies demonstrate that in early asymptomatic stages, ss-amyloid peptide damages the cerebral microvasculature through mechanisms that involve an increase in reactive oxygen species and calcium, which induces necrosis and apoptosis of endothelial cells, leading to cerebrovascular dysfunction. The goal of our work is to study the potential preventive effect of the lipophilic antioxidant coenzyme Q (CoQ) against ss-amyloid-induced damage on human endothelial cells. We analyzed the protective effect of CoQ against Abeta-induced injury in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) using fluorescence and confocal microscopy, biochemical techniques and RMN-based metabolomics. Our results show that CoQ pretreatment of HUVECs delayed Abeta incorporation into the plasma membrane and mitochondria. Moreover, CoQ reduced the influx of extracellular Ca2+, and Ca2+ release from mitochondria due to opening the mitochondrial transition pore after beta-amyloid administration, in addition to decreasing O2.- and H2O2 levels. Pretreatment with CoQ also prevented ss-amyloid-induced HUVECs necrosis and apoptosis, restored their ability to proliferate, migrate and form tube-like structures in vitro, which is mirrored by a restoration of the cell metabolic profile to control levels. CoQ protected endothelial cells from Abeta-induced injury at physiological concentrations in human plasma after oral CoQ supplementation and thus could be a promising molecule to protect endothelial cells against amyloid angiopathy.\", '']\n",

Recently, we have shown that AD-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of amyloid precursor protein (APP) could directly affect miRNA function. In theory, loss of microRNA (miRNA) function could lead to risk for AD by increasing APP expression and Abeta peptide production. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that Nicastrin, a gamma-secretase subunit involved in Abeta generation, could be regulated by miRNAs, and consequently affected by 3'UTR polymorphisms. Bioinformatic analysis identified 22 putative miRNA binding sites located in or near Nicastrin 3'UTR polymorphisms. From these miRNA candidates, six were previously shown to be expressed in human brain. We identified miR-24, miR-186, and miR-455 as regulators of Nicastrin expression, both in vitro and under physiological conditions in human cells, which resulted in altered Abeta secretion. Using luciferase-based assays, we further demonstrated that rs113810300 and rs141849450 SNPs affected miRNA-mediated repression of Nicastrin. Notably, rs141849450 completely abolished the miR-455-mediated repression of Nicastrin. Finally, the rs141849450 variant was identified in 1 out of 511 AD cases but not in 631 controls.

Although mutations in APP and genes that regulate processing of APP, such as PSENs and BRI2/ITM2B, cause dementias, the normal function of APP in synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity and memory formation is poorly understood. To grasp the biochemical mechanisms underlying the function of APP in the central nervous system, it is important to first define the sub-cellular localization of APP in synapses and the synaptic interactome of APP. Using biochemical and electron microscopy approaches, we have found that APP is localized in pre-synaptic vesicles, where it is processed by Bace1. By means of a proteomic approach, we have characterized the synaptic interactome of the APP intracellular domain. We focused on this region of APP because in vivo data underline the central funtional and pathological role of the intracellular domain of APP. Consistent with the expression of APP in pre-synaptic vesicles, the synaptic APP intracellular domain interactome is predominantly constituted by pre-synaptic, rather than post-synaptic, proteins. This pre-synaptic interactome of the APP intracellular domain includes proteins expressed on pre-synaptic vesicles such as the vesicular SNARE Vamp2/Vamp1 and the Ca2+ sensors Synaptotagmin-1/Synaptotagmin-2, and non-vesicular pre-synaptic proteins that regulate exocytosis, endocytosis and recycling of pre-synaptic vesicles, such as target-membrane-SNAREs (Syntaxin-1b, Syntaxin-1a, Snap25 and Snap47), Munc-18, Nsf, alpha/beta/gamma-Snaps and complexin.

It is the leading cause of death in HIV patients in Asia and Africa.No major advance has been made in the treatment of CM since the 1970s. The mainstays of induction therapy are amphotericin B and flucytosine, but these are often poorly available where the disease burden is highest. Adjunctive treatments, such as dexamethasone, have had dramatic effects on mortality in other neurologic infections, but are untested in CM. Given the high death rates in patients receiving current optimal treatment, and the lack of new agents on the horizon, adjuvant treatments, which offer the potential to reduce mortality in CM, should be tested.The principal research question posed by this study is as follows: does adding dexamethasone to standard antifungal therapy for CM reduce mortality? Dexamethasone is a cheap, readily available, and practicable intervention. METHOD: A double-blind placebo-controlled trial with parallel arms in which patients are randomised to receive either dexamethasone or placebo, in addition to local standard of care. The study recruits patients in both Asia and Africa to ensure the relevance of its results to the populations in which the disease burden is highest. The 10-week mortality risk in the control group is expected to be between 30% and 50%, depending on location, and the target hazard ratio of 0.7 corresponds to absolute risk reductions in mortality from 30% to 22%, or from 50% to 38%. Assuming an overall 10-week mortality of at least 30% in our study population, recruitment of 824 patients will be sufficient to observe the expected number of deaths. Allowing for some loss to follow-up, the total sample size for this study is 880 patients. To generate robust evidence across both continents, we aim to recruit roughly similar numbers of patients from each continent. The primary end point is 10-week mortality.

Interactions between brain beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation and a wake-related neurotransmitter hypocretin have been reported in a mouse model of AD. METHODS: Ninety-one cognitive patients (37 AD, 16 mild cognitive impairment-MCI that converts to AD, 38 other dementias) and 15 elderly patients with NC were recruited. Patients were diagnosed blind to CSF results. CSF Abeta42, total tau, ptau181, and hypocretin-1 were measured. Sleep disturbances were assessed with questionnaires in 32 cognitive patients. RESULTS: Lower CSF Abeta42 but higher tau and P-tau levels were found in AD and MCI compared to other dementias. CSF hypocretin-1 levels were higher in patients with MCI due to AD compared to other dementias, with a similar tendency for patients with advanced AD. CSF hypocretin-1 was significantly and independently associated with AD/MCI due to AD, with an OR of 2.70 after full adjustment, exceeding that for Abeta42. Abeta42 correlated positively with hypocretin-1 levels in advanced stage AD. No association was found between sleep disturbances and CSF biomarkers. No patients with NC achieved pathological cutoffs for Abeta42, with respectively one and four patients with NC above tau and P-tau cutoffs and no correlations between hypocretin-1 and other biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a pathophysiological relationship between Abeta42 and hypocretin-1 in the AD process, with higher CSF hypocretin-1 levels in early disease stages.

Thus, unconstrained, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent have been performed to characterize the Abeta17-42 assembly in presence of the alphaB-crystallin core domain and of lysozyme. Simulations reveal that both inhibitor proteins compete with inter-peptide interaction by binding to the peptides during the early stage of aggregation, which is consistent with their inhibitory action reported in experiments. However, the Abeta binding dynamics appear different for each inhibitor. The binding between crystallin and the peptide monomer, dominated by electrostatics, is relatively weak and transient due to the heterogeneous amino acid distribution of the inhibitor surface. The crystallin-bound Abeta oligomers are relatively long-lived, as they form more extensive contact surface with the inhibitor protein. In contrast, a high local density of arginines from lysozyme allows strong binding with Abeta peptide monomers, resulting in stable complexes. Our findings not only illustrate, in atomic detail, how the amyloid inhibitory mechanism of human alphaB-crystallin, a natural chaperone, is different from that of human lysozyme, but also may aid de novo design of amyloid inhibitors.\", '']\n",

Because Abeta deposition in the brain occurs in an activity-dependent manner, it is important to define the subcellular organelle for pGlu-Abeta(3-40/42) production by glutaminyl cyclase (QC) and their colocalization with full-length Abeta(1-40/42) peptides for activity-dependent, regulated secretion. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that pGlu-Abeta and QC are colocalized with Abeta in dense-core secretory vesicles (DCSV) for activity-dependent secretion with neurotransmitters. METHODS: Purified DCSV were assessed for pGlu-Abeta(3-40/42), Abeta(1-40/42), QC, and neurotransmitter secretion. Neuron-like chromaffin cells were analyzed for cosecretion of pGlu-Abeta, QC, Abeta, and neuropeptides. The cells were treated with a QC inhibitor, and pGlu-Abeta production was measured. Human neuroblastoma cells were also examined for pGlu-Abeta and QC secretion. RESULTS: Isolated DCSV contain pGlu-Abeta(3-40/42), QC, and Abeta(1-40/42) with neuropeptide and catecholamine neurotransmitters. Cellular pGlu-Abeta and QC undergo activity-dependent cosecretion with Abeta and enkephalin and galanin neurotransmitters. The QC inhibitor decreased the level of secreted pGlu-Abeta. The human neuroblastoma cells displayed regulated secretion of pGlu-Abeta that was colocalized with QC. CONCLUSIONS: pGlu-Abeta and QC are present with Abeta in DCSV and undergo activity-dependent, regulated cosecretion with neurotransmitters.\", '']\n",

E., et al.;2014;\", \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia. In addition to grey matter pathology, white matter changes are now recognized as an important pathological feature in the emergence of the disease. Despite growing recognition of the importance of white matter abnormalities in the pathogenesis of AD, the causes of white matter degeneration are still unknown. While multiple studies propose Wallerian-like degeneration as the source of white matter change, others suggest that primary white matter pathology may be due, at least in part, to other mechanisms, including local effects of toxic Abeta peptides. In the current study, we investigated levels of soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) in white matter of AD patients (n=12) compared with controls (n=10). Fresh frozen white matter samples were obtained from anterior (Brodmann area 9) and posterior (Brodmann area 1, 2 and 3) areas of post-mortem AD and control brains. ELISA was used to examine levels of soluble Abeta -42 and Abeta -40. Total cortical neuritic plaque severity rating was derived from individual ratings in the following areas of cortex: mid-frontal, superior temporal, pre-central, inferior parietal, hippocampus (CA1), subiculum, entorhinal cortex, transentorhinal cortex, inferior temporal, amygdala and basal forebrain. Compared with controls, AD samples had higher white matter levels of both soluble Abeta -42 and Abeta -40. While no regional white matter differences were found in Abeta -40, Abeta -42 levels were higher in anterior regions than in posterior regions across both groups. After statistically controlling for total cortical neuritic plaque severity, differences in both soluble Abeta -42 and Abeta -40 between the groups remained, suggesting that white matter Abeta peptides accumulate independent of overall grey matter fibrillar amyloid pathology and are not simply a reflection of overall amyloid burden. These results shed light on one potential mechanism through which white matter degeneration may occur in AD. Given that white matter degeneration may be an early marker of disease, preceding grey matter atrophy, understanding the mechanisms and risk factors that may lead to white matter loss could help to identify those at high risk and to intervene earlier in the pathogenic process.\", '']\n",

Foot problems and inappropriate footwear may increase the risk of falls; therefore podiatric interventions may play a role in reducing falls. Two Cochrane systematic reviews identified only one study of a podiatry intervention aimed to reduce falls, which was undertaken in Australia. The REFORM trial aims to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a multifaceted podiatry intervention in reducing falls in people aged 65 years and over in a UK and Irish setting. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This multicentre, cohort randomised controlled trial will recruit 2600 participants from routine podiatry clinics in the UK and Ireland to the REFORM cohort. In order to detect a 10% point reduction in falls from 50% to 40%, with 80% power 890 participants will be randomised to receive routine podiatry care and a falls prevention leaflet or routine podiatry care, a falls prevention leaflet and a multifaceted podiatry intervention. The primary outcome is rate of falls (falls/person/time) over 12 months assessed by patient self-report falls diary. Secondary self-report outcome measures include: the proportion of single and multiple fallers and time to first fall over a 12-month period; Short Falls Efficacy Scale-International; fear of falling in the past 4 weeks; Frenchay Activities Index; fracture rate; Geriatric Depression Scale; EuroQoL-five dimensional scale 3-L; health service utilisation at 6 and 12 months. A qualitative study will examine the acceptability of the package of care to participants and podiatrists. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial has received a favourable opinion from the East of England-Cambridge East Research Ethics Committee and Galway Research Ethics Committee. The trial results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and at conference presentations. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN68240461 assigned 01/07/2011.', '']\n",

Depending on the mutant PS1 dosage, we demonstrate a clear aggravation in both plaque-associated and plaque-distant axonal degeneration, despite of an unchanged APP expression level. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides were found to accumulate in axonal swellings as well as in axons and apical dendrites proximate to neurons accumulating intraneuronal Abeta in their cell bodies. This suggests that Abeta can be transported within neurites thereby contributing to axonal deficits.

Most AMPARs are Ca(2+)-impermeable because of the presence of the GluA2 subunit. GluA2 mRNA undergoes an editing process that results in a Q-R substitution, a key factor in the regulation of AMPAR Ca(2+)-permeability. AMPARs lacking GluA2 or containing the unedited subunit are permeable to Ca(2+) and Zn(2+). The phenomenon physiologically modulates synaptic plasticity while, in pathologic conditions, leads to increased vulnerability to excitotoxic neuronal death. Given the importance of these subunits, we have therefore evaluated possible associations between changes in expression levels of AMPAR subunits and development of cognitive deficits in 3xTg-AD mice, a widely investigated transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). With quantitative real-time PCR analysis, we assayed hippocampal mRNA expression levels of GluA1-4 subunits occurring in young [3 months of age (m.o.a.)] and old (12 m.o.a) Tg-AD mice and made comparisons with levels found in age-matched wild type (WT) mice. Efficiency of GluA2 RNA editing was also analyzed. All animals were cognitively tested for learning short- and long-term spatial memory with the Morris Water Maze (MWM) navigation task. 3xTg-AD mice showed age-dependent decreases of mRNA levels for all the AMPAR subunits, with the exception of GluA2. Editing remained fully efficient with aging in 3xTg-AD and WT mice. A one-to-one correlation analysis between MWM performances and GluA1-4 mRNA expression profiles showed negative correlations between GluA2 levels and MWM performances in young 3xTg-AD mice. On the contrary, positive correlations between GluA2 mRNA and MWM performances were found in young WT mice.

It is widely believed that BACE1 initiates APP processing in endosomes, and in the brain this cleavage is known to occur during axonal transport of APP. In addition, BACE1 accumulates in dystrophic neurites surrounding brain senile plaques in individuals with AD, suggesting that abnormal accumulation of BACE1 at presynaptic terminals contributes to pathogenesis in AD. However, only limited information is available on BACE1 axonal transport and targeting. RESULTS: By visualizing BACE1-YFP dynamics using live imaging, we demonstrate that BACE1 undergoes bi-directional transport in dynamic tubulo-vesicular carriers along axons in cultured hippocampal neurons and in acute hippocampal slices of transgenic mice. In addition, a subset of BACE1 is present in larger stationary structures, which are active presynaptic sites. In cultured neurons, BACE1-YFP is preferentially targeted to axons over time, consistent with predominant in vivo localization of BACE1 in presynaptic terminals. Confocal analysis and dual-color live imaging revealed a localization and dynamic transport of BACE1 along dendrites and axons in Rab11-positive recycling endosomes. Impairment of Rab11 function leads to a diminution of total and endocytosed BACE1 in axons, concomitant with an increase in the soma. Together, these results suggest that BACE1 is sorted to axons in endosomes in a Rab11-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal novel information on dynamic BACE1 transport in neurons, and demonstrate that Rab11-GTPase function is critical for axonal sorting of BACE1. Thus, we suggest that BACE1 transcytosis in endosomes contributes to presynaptic BACE1 localization.\", '']\n",

      "[\"4098123;25076902;Metal and complementary molecular bioimaging in Alzheimer's disease;Braidy, N., et al.;2014;\", \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly, affecting over 27 million people worldwide. AD represents a complex neurological disorder which is best understood as the consequence of a number of interconnected genetic and lifestyle variables, which culminate in multiple changes to brain structure and function. These can be observed on a gross anatomical level in brain atrophy, microscopically in extracellular amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle formation, and at a functional level as alterations of metabolic activity. At a molecular level, metal dyshomeostasis is frequently observed in AD due to anomalous binding of metals such as Iron (Fe), Copper (Cu), and Zinc (Zn), or impaired regulation of redox-active metals which can induce the formation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species and neuronal damage. Metal chelators have been administered therapeutically in transgenic mice models for AD and in clinical human AD studies, with positive outcomes. As a result, neuroimaging of metals in a variety of intact brain cells and tissues is emerging as an important tool for increasing our understanding of the role of metal dysregulation in AD. Several imaging techniques have been used to study the cerebral metallo-architecture in biological specimens to obtain spatially resolved data on chemical elements present in a sample. Hyperspectral techniques, such as particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM), synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) can reveal relative intensities and even semi-quantitative concentrations of a large set of elements with differing spatial resolution and detection sensitivities. Other mass spectrometric and spectroscopy imaging techniques such as laser ablation electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LA ESI-MS), MALDI imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) can be used to correlate changes in elemental distribution with the underlying pathology in AD brain specimens. Taken together, these techniques provide new techniques to probe the pathobiology of AD and pave the way for identifying new therapeutic targets. The current review aims to discuss the advantages and challenges of using these emerging elemental and molecular imaging techniques, and highlight clinical achievements in AD research using bioimaging techniques.\", '']\n",

However, this approach has no effect on the underlying beta-amyloid (Abeta) and neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Long term efficacy of cell based approaches may therefore require combinatorial approaches. METHODS: To begin to examine this question we genetically-modified NSCs to stably express and secrete the Abeta-degrading enzyme, neprilysin (sNEP). Next, we studied the effects of sNEP expression in vitro by quantifying Abeta-degrading activity, NSC multipotency markers, and Abeta-induced toxicity. To determine whether sNEP-expressing NSCs can also modulate AD-pathogenesis in vivo, control-modified and sNEP-NSCs were transplanted unilaterally into the hippocampus of two independent and well characterized transgenic models of AD: 3xTg-AD and Thy1-APP mice. After three months, stem cell engraftment, neprilysin expression, and AD pathology were examined. RESULTS: Our findings reveal that stem cell-mediated delivery of NEP provides marked and significant reductions in Abeta pathology and increases synaptic density in both 3xTg-AD and Thy1-APP transgenic mice. Remarkably, Abeta plaque loads are reduced not only in the hippocampus and subiculum adjacent to engrafted NSCs, but also within the amygdala and medial septum, areas that receive afferent projections from the engrafted region. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data suggest that genetically-modified NSCs could provide a powerful combinatorial approach to not only enhance synaptic plasticity but to also target and modify underlying Alzheimer's disease pathology.\", '']\n",

We investigated Th1 and Th17 type responses to Hp in adults, children and infants in Bangladesh, where Hp is highly endemic. IL-17 and IFN-gamma mRNA levels in gastric biopsies from Hp-infected Bangladeshi adults were analyzed and compared to levels in infected and uninfected Swedish controls. Since biopsies could not be collected from infants and children, cytokine responses in Bangladeshi infants (6-12 months), children (3-5 years) and adults (>19 years) were instead compared by stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with a Hp membrane preparation (MP) and analyzing culture supernatants by ELISA and cytometric bead array. We found significantly higher expression of IL-17 and IFN-gamma mRNA in gastric mucosa of Hp-infected Bangladeshi and Swedish adults compared to uninfected Swedish controls. PBMCs from all age groups produced IL-17 and IFN-gamma after MP stimulation, but little Th2 cytokines. IL-17 and IFN-gamma were primarily produced by CD4+ T cells, since CD4+ T cell depleted PBMCs produced reduced amounts of these cytokines. Infant cells produced significantly more IL-17, but similar levels of IFN-gamma, compared to adult cells after MP stimulation. In contrast, polyclonal stimulation induced lower levels IL-17 and IFN-gamma in infant compared to adult PBMCs and CD4+ T cells. The strong IL-17 production in infants after MP stimulation was paralleled by significantly higher production of the IL-17 promoting cytokine IL-1beta from infant compared to adult PBMCs and monocytes. In conclusion, these results show that T cells can produce high levels of IL-17 and IFN-gamma in response to Hp from an early age and indicate a potential role for IL-1beta in promoting Th17 responses to Hp during infancy.', '']\n",

The manipulation of adaptive immunity has been a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD, although vaccine and anti-Abeta antibody approaches have proven difficult in patients, thus far. CD4(+) T cells have a central role in regulating adaptive immune responses to antigens, and Abeta-specific CD4(+) T cells have been shown to reduce AD pathology in mouse models. As these cells may facilitate endogenous mechanisms that counter AD, an evaluation of their abundance before and during AD could provide important insights. Abeta-CD4see is a new assay developed to quantify Abeta-specific CD4(+) T cells in human blood, using dendritic cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells. In tests of >50 human subjects Abeta-CD4see showed an age-dependent decline of Abeta-specific CD4(+) T cells, which occurs earlier in women than men. In aggregate, men showed a 50% decline in these cells by the age of 70 years, but women reached the same level before the age of 60 years. Notably, women who carried the AD risk marker apolipoproteinE-varepsilon4 (ApoE4) showed the earliest decline, with a precipitous drop between 45 and 52 years, when menopause typically begins. Abeta-CD4see requires a standard blood draw and provides a minimally invasive approach for assessing changes in Abeta biology that may reveal AD-related changes in physiology by a decade. Furthermore, CD4see probes can be modified to target any peptide, providing a powerful new tool to isolate antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells from human subjects.\", '']\n",

DESIGN AND SETTING: Longitudinal birth cohort study in northeast England, cross-sectional analysis. PARTICIPANTS: 425 children (41% of the original cohort) aged 6-8 years (49% boys). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PA over 7 days was measured objectively by an accelerometer; three categories of PA were created: 'active' >/=60 min/day moderate-to-vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA); 'moderately active' 30-59 min/day MVPA; 'inactive' <30 min/day MVPA. Dietary intake over 4 days was measured using a prospective dietary assessment tool which incorporated elements of the food diary and food frequency methods. Three diet categories were created: 'healthy', 'unhealthy' and 'mixed', according to the number of portions of different foods consumed. Adherence to the '5-a-day' recommendations for portions of fruit and vegetables was also assessed. Children were classified as 'healthy weight' or 'overweight or obese' (OW/OB) according to International Obesity Taskforce cutpoints for BMI. Associations between weight status and PA/diet categories were analysed using logistic regression. RESULTS: Few children met the UK-recommended guidelines for either MVPA or fruit and vegetable intake, with just 7% meeting the recommended amount of MVPA of 60 min/day, and 3% meeting the 5-a-day fruit and vegetable recommendation. Higher PA was associated with a lower OR for OW/OB in boys only (0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.88). There was no association detected between dietary intake and OW/OB in either sex. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing MVPA may help to reduce OW/OB in boys; however, more research is required to examine this relationship in girls. Children are not meeting the UK guidelines for diet and PA, and more needs to be done to improve this situation.\", '']\n",

The HIV response in Swaziland has traditionally focused on decreasing HIV acquisition and transmission risks in the general population through interventions such as male circumcision, increasing treatment uptake and adherence, and risk-reduction counseling. There is emerging data from Southern Africa that key populations such as female sex workers (FSW) carry a disproportionate burden of HIV even in generalized epidemics such as Swaziland. The burden of HIV and prevention needs among FSW remains unstudied in Swaziland. METHODS: A respondent-driven-sampling survey was completed between August-October, 2011 of 328 FSW in Swaziland. Each participant completed a structured survey instrument and biological HIV and syphilis testing according to Swazi Guidelines. RESULTS: Unadjusted HIV prevalence was 70.3% (n = 223/317) among a sample of women predominantly from Swaziland (95.2%, n = 300/316) with a mean age of 21(median 25) which was significantly higher than the general population of women. Approximately one-half of the FSW(53.4%, n = 167/313) had received HIV prevention information related to sex work in the previous year, and about one-in-ten had been part of a previous research project(n = 38/313). Rape was common with nearly 40% (n = 123/314) reporting at least one rape; 17.4% (n = 23/314)reported being raped 6 or more times. Reporting blackmail (34.8%, n = 113/314) and torture(53.2%, n = 173/314) was prevalent. CONCLUSIONS: While Swaziland has a highly generalized HIV epidemic, reconceptualizing the needs of key populations such as FSW suggests that these women represent a distinct population with specific vulnerabilities and a high burden of HIV compared to other women. These women are understudied and underserved resulting in a limited characterization of their HIV prevention, treatment, and care needs and only sparse specific and competent programming.

We estimated time to lymphoma-specific death (approach 1 and 2) and lymphoma progression (approach 2) with hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) in a multivariable Cox regression model. RESULTS: In the GWAS meta-analysis, using a random effects model, no variants were associated with lymphoma-specific death at a genome-wide significant level (p < 5.0 x10(-8)).

Pharmacological efforts to limit Abeta buildup have proven ineffective, and this raises the twin challenges of understanding the adverse effects of Abeta on synapses and of suggesting pharmacological means to prevent them. The purpose of this paper is to initiate a computational approach to understanding the dysregulation by Abeta of synaptic plasticity and to offer suggestions whereby combinations of various chemical compounds could be arrayed against it. This data-driven approach confronts the complexity of synaptic plasticity by representing findings from the literature in a course-grained manner, and focuses on understanding the aggregate behavior of many molecular interactions. The same set of interactions is modeled by two different computer programs, each written using a different programming modality: one imperative, the other declarative. Both programs compute the same results over an extensive test battery, providing an essential crosscheck. Then the imperative program is used for the computationally intensive purpose of determining the effects on the model of every combination of ten different compounds, while the declarative program is used to analyze model behavior using temporal logic. Together these two model implementations offer new insights into the mechanisms by which Abeta dysregulates synaptic plasticity and suggest many drug combinations that potentially may reduce or prevent it.', '']\n",

In this context, we define phenotyping as the extraction of all clinically relevant features contained in the EHR. METHODS: The scope of the project was framed by the Common Meaningful Use (MU) Dataset terminology standards; the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), RxNorm, the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC), the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT), the Health care Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS), the International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), and the International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) was used as a mapping layer among the MU ontologies. An extract, load, and transform approach separated original annotations in the EHR from the mapping process and allowed for continuous updates as the terminologies were updated. Additionally, we integrated all terminologies into a single UMLS derived ontology and further optimized it to make the relatively large concept graph manageable. RESULTS: The initial evaluation was performed with simulated data from the Clinical Avatars project using 100,000 virtual patients undergoing a 90 day, genotype guided, warfarin dosing protocol. This dataset was annotated with standard MU terminologies, loaded, and transformed using the UMLS. We have deployed this methodology to scale in our in-house analytics platform using structured EHR data for 7931 patients (12 million clinical observations) treated at the Froedtert Hospital. A demonstration limited to Clinical Avatars data is available on the Internet using the credentials user \"jmirdemo\" and password \"jmirdemo\". CONCLUSIONS: Despite its inherent complexity, the UMLS can serve as an effective interface terminology for many of the clinical data standards currently used in the health care domain.', '']\n",

A., et al.;2014;', \"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization recommends strategies to improve urban design, public transportation, and recreation facilities to facilitate physical activity for non-communicable disease prevention for an increasingly urbanized global population. Most evidence supporting environmental associations with physical activity comes from single countries or regions with limited variation in urban form. This paper documents variation in comparable built environment features across countries from diverse regions. METHODS: The International Physical Activity and the Environment Network (IPEN) study of adults aimed to measure the full range of variation in the built environment using geographic information systems (GIS) across 12 countries on 5 continents. Investigators in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, China, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States followed a common research protocol to develop internationally comparable measures. Using detailed instructions, GIS-based measures included features such as walkability (i.e., residential density, street connectivity, mix of land uses), and access to public transit, parks, and private recreation facilities around each participant's residential address using 1-km and 500-m street network buffers. RESULTS: Eleven of 12 countries and 15 cities had objective GIS data on built environment features. We observed a 38-fold difference in median residential densities, a 5-fold difference in median intersection densities and an 18-fold difference in median park densities. Hong Kong had the highest and North Shore, New Zealand had the lowest median walkability index values, representing a difference of 9 standard deviations in GIS-measured walkability. CONCLUSIONS: Results show that comparable measures can be created across a range of cultural settings revealing profound global differences in urban form relevant to physical activity. These measures allow cities to be ranked more precisely than previously possible. The highly variable measures of urban form will be used to explain individuals' physical activity, sedentary behaviors, body mass index, and other health outcomes on an international basis. Present measures provide the ability to estimate dose-response relationships from projected changes to the built environment that would otherwise be impossible.\", '']\n",

Interventions to improve IPT delivery could promote implementation. The large number of existing systematic reviews on treatment adherence has made drawing conclusions a challenge. To provide decision makers with the evidence they need, we performed an overview of systematic reviews to compare different organizational interventions to improve IPT delivery as measured by treatment completion among those at highest risk for the development of TB disease, namely child contacts or HIV-infected individuals. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), and MEDLINE up to August 15, 2012. Two authors used a standardized data extraction form and the AMSTAR instrument to independently assess each review. RESULTS: Six reviews met inclusion criteria. Interventions included changes in the setting/site of IPT delivery, use of quality monitoring mechanisms (e.g., directly observed therapy), IPT delivery integration into other healthcare services, and use of lay health workers. Most reviews reported a combination of outcomes related to IPT adherence and treatment completion rate but without a baseline or comparison rate. Generally, we found limited evidence to demonstrate that the studied interventions improved treatment completion. CONCLUSIONS: While most of the interventions were not shown to improve IPT completion, integration of tuberculosis and HIV services yielded high treatment completion rates in some settings. The lack of data from high burden TB settings limits applicability. Further research to assess different IPT delivery interventions, including those that address barriers to care in at-risk populations, is urgently needed to identify the most effective practices for IPT delivery and TB control in high TB burden settings.', '']\n",

METHODS: Data about notified occupational accidents were collected from notifications sent to the Danish Maritime Authority and from records of contact with Danish Radio Medical. Events were matched by personal identification and accident data to create a unified database. Stratified cumulative time spent on board by seafarers was used to calculate accident rates. Incidence rates of different nationalities were compared by Poisson regression. RESULTS: Western European seafarers had an overall accident rate of 17.5 per 100000 person-days, which proved to be significantly higher than that of Eastern European, South East Asian and Indian seaman (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.53, 0.51 and 0.74, respectively), although differences decreased over the investigated period. Smaller but in most cases still significant discrepancies were observed for serious injuries. The back injury rate of Western European employees was found especially high, while eye injuries seem to be more frequent among South East Asian workers.

Neuronal differentiation of stem cells before transplantation is a promising procedure for cell therapy. However, the therapeutic impact and mechanisms of action of neuron-like cells differentiated from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in AD have not been determined. METHODS: In this study, we used tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate (D609) to induce human mesenchymal stem cells isolated from Wharton jelly of the umbilical cord (HUMSCs) to differentiate into neuron-like cells (HUMSC-NCs), and transplanted the HUMSC-NCs into an AbetaPP/PS1 transgenic AD mouse model. The effects of HUMSC-NC transplantation on the cognitive function, synapsin I level, amyloid beta-peptides (Abeta) deposition, and microglial function of the mice were investigated. RESULTS: We found that transplantation of HUMSC-NCs into AbetaPP/PS1 mice improved the cognitive function, increased synapsin I level, and significantly reduced Abeta deposition in the mice. The beneficial effects were associated with \"alternatively activated\" microglia (M2-like microglia). In the mice transplanted with HUMSC-NCs, M2-like microglial activation was significantly increased, and the expression of antiinflammatory cytokine associated with M2-like microglia, interleukin-4 (IL-4), was also increased, whereas the expression of proinflammatory cytokines associated with classic microglia (M1-like microglia), including interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), was significantly reduced. Moreover, the expression of Abeta-degrading factors, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and neprilysin (NEP), was increased substantially in the mice treated with HUMSC-NCs. CONCLUSIONS: HUMSC-NC transplantation decreased Abeta deposition and improved memory in AbetaPP/PS1 mice by a mechanism associated with activating M2-like microglia and modulating neuroinflammation. Transplantation of neuron-like cells differentiated from mesenchymal stem cells might be a promising cell therapy for Alzheimer disease.', '']\n",

An early marker of AD pathology is therefore needed and it is debated as to whether amyloid-betaAbeta? plaque load may serve this purpose. We investigated this in the hAPP-J20 AD mouse model by studying disease pathology at 6, 12, 24 and 36 weeks. Using robust stereological methods, we found there is no neuron loss in the hippocampal CA3 region at any age. However loss of neurons from the hippocampal CA1 region begins as early as 12 weeks of age. The extent of neuron loss increases with age, correlating with the number of activated microglia. Gliosis was also present, but plateaued during aging. Increased hyperactivity and spatial memory deficits occurred at 16 and 24 weeks. Meanwhile, the appearance of plaques and oligomeric Abeta were essentially the last pathological changes, with significant changes only observed at 36 weeks of age. This is surprising given that the hAPP-J20 AD mouse model is engineered to over-expresses Abeta. Our data raises the possibility that plaque load may not be the best marker for early AD and suggests that activated microglia could be a valuable marker to track disease progression.\", '']\n",

Recent studies support the hypothesis that the accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide within the brain arises from an imbalance of the production and clearance of Abeta. In rare genetic forms of AD, this imbalance is often caused by increased production of Abeta. However, recent evidence indicates that, in the majority of cases of AD, Abeta clearance is impaired. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), the dominant cholesterol and lipid carrier in the brain, is critical for Abeta catabolism. The isoform of ApoE and its degree of lipidation critically regulate the efficiency of Abeta clearance. Studies in preclinical models of AD have demonstrated that coordinately increasing levels of ApoE and its lipid transporter, ABCA1, increases the clearance of Abeta, suggesting that this pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for AD.\", '']\n",

To examine the potential of Cudrania cochinchinensis to ameliorate amyloid beta protein (Abeta)-induced microglia activation, BV-2 microglial cell line, and the ramified microglia in the primary glial mixed cultured were employed. RESULTS: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), fibrillary Abeta (fAbeta), or oligomeric Abeta (oAbeta) were used to activate microglia. LPS and IFN-gamma, but not Abetas, activated BV-2 cells to produce nitric oxide through an increase in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression without significant effects on cell viability of microglia. fAbeta, but not oAbeta, enhanced the IFN-gamma-stimulated nitric oxide production and iNOS expression.The ethanol/water extracts of Cudrania cochinchinensis (CC-EW) and the purified isolated components (i.e. CCA to CCF) effectively reduced the nitric oxide production and iNOS expression stimulated by IFN-gamma combined with fAbeta. On the other hand, oAbeta effectively activated the ramified microglia in mixed glial culture by observing the morphological alteration of the microglia from ramified to amoeboid. CC-EW and CCB effectively prohibit the Abeta-mediated morphological change of microglia. Furthermore, CC-EW and CCB effectively decreased Abeta deposition and remained Abeta in the conditioned medium suggesting the effect of CC-EW and CCB on promoting Abeta clearance.

While increasing evidence suggests that inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) may mitigate certain aspects of AD neuropathology, the precise role of different NMDAR subtypes for Abeta- and tau-mediated toxicity remains to be elucidated. Using mouse organotypic hippocampal slice cultures from arcAbeta transgenic mice combined with Sindbis virus-mediated expression of human wild-type tau protein (hTau), we show that Abeta caused dendritic spine loss independently of tau. However, the presence of hTau was required for Abeta-induced cell death accompanied by increased hTau phosphorylation. Inhibition of NR2B-containing NMDARs abolished Abeta-induced hTau phosphorylation and toxicity by preventing GSK-3beta activation but did not affect dendritic spine loss. Inversely, NR2A-containing NMDAR inhibition as well as NR2A-subunit knockout diminished dendritic spine loss but not the Abeta effect on hTau. Activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs in primary neurons caused degeneration of hTau-expressing neurons, which could be prevented by NR2B-NMDAR inhibition but not by NR2A knockout. Furthermore, caspase-3 activity was increased in arcAbeta transgenic cultures. Activity was reduced by NR2A knockout but not by NR2B inhibition. Accordingly, caspase-3 inhibition abolished spine loss but not hTau-dependent toxicity in arcAbeta transgenic slice cultures. Our data show that Abeta induces dendritic spine loss via a pathway involving NR2A-containing NMDARs and active caspase-3 whereas activation of eSyn NR2B-containing NMDARs is required for hTau-dependent neurodegeneration, independent of caspase-3.\", '']\n",

The single demented 54 year old DS subject was compared to 4 non-demented controls between 48 and 61 years of age. 50 mum Vibratome sections of formalin fixed hippocampal formations were immunohistochemically stained for amyloid-beta (6E10), APP (22C11) and phosphorylated tau (AT8) using standard methods. AT8 immunoreactive features were found only in the oldest DS subject. In contrast, the number and intensity of amyloid-beta-immunoreactive neurons were maximal in the youngest DS subjects (1-24 years), reduced in the young adults (25-35 years) synchronous with the appearance of only diffuse-form SP, and were further reduced in the 54 year-old DS subject exhibiting abundant multiform SP. Distribution of APP immunoreactivity (22C11) was distinct from amyloid-beta (6E10) in appearance and by location and age in both DS and normal controls. The data indicates that the earliest observable neuropathologic feature in DS may be neuronal accumulation of amyloid-beta. Such accumulation of amyloid-beta occurs decades in advance of deposition as SP, which in turn occurs decades before cognitive decline.\", '']\n",

Passive anti-Abeta immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach for the therapy of AD, based on the administration of specific anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies (aAbetamAbs) to delay Abeta aggregation in the brain. However, the main disadvantage of this approach is the required readministration of the aAbetamAbs at frequent intervals. There are only a few reports describing in vitro study for the immobilization of aAbetamAbs to nanoparticles as potential targeting agents of Abeta aggregates. In this article, we report the immobilization of the aAbetamAb clone BAM10 to near-infrared fluorescent maghemite nanoparticles for the inhibition of Abeta40 fibrillation kinetics and the specific detection of Abeta40 fibrils. The BAM10-conjugated iron oxide nanoparticles were well-characterized, including their immunogold labeling and cytotoxic effect on PC-12 (pheochromocytoma cell line). Indeed, these antibody-conjugated nanoparticles significantly inhibit the Abeta40 fibrillation kinetics compared with the same concentration, or even five times higher, of the free BAM10. This inhibitory effect was confirmed by different assays such as the photo-induced crosslinking of unmodified proteins combined with sodium dodecyl sulfate- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A cell viability assay also confirmed that these antibody-conjugated nanoparticles significantly reduced the Abeta40-induced cytotoxicity to PC-12 cells. Furthermore, the selective labeling of the Abeta40 fibrils with the BAM10-conjugated near-infrared fluorescent iron oxide nanoparticles enabled specific detection of Abeta40 fibrils ex vivo by both magnetic resonance imaging and fluorescence imaging. This study highlights the immobilization of the aAbetamAb to dual-modal nanoparticles as a potential approach for aAbetamAb delivery, eliminating the issue of readministration, and contributes to the development of multifunctional agents for diagnosis and therapy of AD.\", '']\n",

METHODS: Fluorescent or radiolabeled liposomes composed of sphingomyelin/cholesterol and containing phosphatidic acid, known to bind amyloid-beta, were further functionalized with the anti-transferrin receptor antibody RI7217. Two different techniques were used to attach RI7217 to the liposomes surface: biotin/streptavidin linkage or thiol-maleimide covalent ligation. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and immunoblotting were employed to assess the nanoparticles' binding performances. Confocal microscopy and radiochemical techniques were used for uptake and permeability studies on an in vitro BBB model made of human brain capillary endothelial cells hCMEC/D3. RESULTS: Immunoblotting experiments showed that RI7217-functionalized liposomes bind to transferrin receptor independently of the procedure employed to ligate their surface with the antibody, while SPR experiments showed a slightly higher affinity for covalently functionalized nanoliposomes. The functionalization with RI7217 did not affect the liposomes' affinity for amyloid-beta. The functionalization of liposomes with RI7217, independently of the ligation procedure, gave higher values of uptake and permeability across the barrier model in comparison to the nondecorated ones, without cell monolayer alterations. Of note, the best performing particles were those covalently coupled with the antibody. The ratios of the two radiolabeled lipids ((3)H-sphingomyelin and (14)C-phosphatidic acid) present in the liposome bilayer were found to be similar in the apical and in the basolateral compartments of the barrier model, suggesting that liposomes were transported intact across the cell monolayer. Confocal experiments showed no co-localization of RI7217-liposomes with early/late endosomes or early lysosomes. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that RI7217 promotes the in vitro barrier crossing of liposomes containing phosphatidic acid, targeting the Alzheimer's disease amyloid-beta peptide. Moreover, for the first time, we prove herein the superior efficiency of covalent coupling of RI7217 versus biotin/streptavidin ligation to facilitate liposomes in overcoming the BBB in vitro.\", '']\n",

This notion however gives us a hope that, by manipulating the Abeta levels in the brain, we may be able not only to prevent and cure the disease but also to partially control some very significant aspects of brain aging. Abeta is constantly produced from its precursor and immediately catabolized under normal conditions, whereas dysmetabolism of Abeta seems to lead to pathological deposition upon aging. We have focused our attention on elucidation of the unresolved mechanism of Abeta catabolism in the brain. In this review, I describe a new approach to prevent AD development by reducing Abeta burdens in aging brains through up-regulation of the catabolic mechanism involving neprilysin that can degrade both monomeric and oligomeric forms of Abeta. The strategy of combining presymptomatic diagnosis with preventive medicine seems to be the most pragmatic in both medical and socioeconomical terms.(Communicated by Kunihiko SUZUKI, M.J.A.).', '']\n",

Recent evidence has suggested that this method is not 100% effective in producing an aggregate free solution. We show, using dynamic light scattering, size exclusion chromatography and small angle X-ray scattering that this is indeed the case, with HFIP pretreated Abeta peptide solutions displaying an increased proportion of oligomeric and aggregated material and an increased propensity to aggregate. Furthermore we show that an alternative technique, involving treatment with strong alkali results in a much more homogenous solution that is largely monomeric.

Small, soluble Abeta oligomers have been shown to be more neurotoxic than large, insoluble aggregates and fibrils. Recent studies suggest that biometal ions, including Zn(II), may play an important role in the aggregation process. Experimentally determining the details of the binding process is complicated by the kinetic lability of zinc. To study the dynamic nature of the zinc-bound Abeta complexes and the potential mechanisms by which Zn(II) affects Abeta oligomerization we have performed atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Zn(Abeta) and Zn(Abeta)2. The models were based on NMR data and predicted coordination environments from previous density functional theory calculations. When modeled as 4-coordinate covalently bound Zn(Abeta) n complexes (where n = 1 or 2), zinc imposes conformational changes in the surrounding Abeta residues. Moreover, zinc reduces the helix content and increases the random coil content of the full peptide. Although zinc binds at the N-terminus of Abeta, beta-sheet formation is observed exclusively at the C-terminus in the Zn(Abeta) and most of the Zn(Abeta)2 complexes. Furthermore, initial binding to zinc promotes the formation of intra-chain salt-bridges, while subsequent dissociation promotes the formation of inter-chain salt-bridges. These results suggest that Zn-binding to Abeta accelerates the aggregation of Abeta by unfolding the helical structure in Abeta peptide and stabilizing the formation of vital salt-bridges within and between Abeta peptides.\", '']\n",

In this study, we focused on biocompatibility issues, evaluating production of nitric oxide by cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and macrophages, used as models of cells which would be exposed to nanoparticles after systemic administration. METHODS: The nanoparticles tested were liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles carrying phosphatidic acid or cardiolipin, and PEGylated poly(alkyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles (PEG-PACA). We measured nitric oxide production using the Griess method as well as phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and intracellular free calcium, which are biochemically related to nitric oxide production. MTT viability tests and caspase-3 detection were also undertaken. RESULTS: Exposure to liposomes did not affect the viability of endothelial cells at any concentration tested. Increased production of nitric oxide was detected only with liposomes carrying phosphatidic acid or cardiolipin at the highest concentration (120 mug/mL), together with increased synthase phosphorylation and intracellular calcium levels. Macrophages exposed to liposomes showed a slightly dose-dependent decrease in viability, with no increase in production of nitric oxide. Exposure to solid lipid nanoparticles carrying phosphatidic acid decreased viability in both cell lines, starting at the lowest dose (10 mug/mL), with increased production of nitric oxide detected only at the highest dose (1500 mug/mL). Exposure to PEG-PACA affected cell viability and production of nitric oxide in both cell lines, but only at the highest concentration (640 mug/mL). CONCLUSION: Liposomal and PEG-PACA nanoparticles have a limited effect on vascular homeostasis and inflammatory response, rendering them potentially suitable for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

The antiapoptotic and antioxidative mechanisms of GE were also studied in A beta -treated pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. In vivo studies demonstrated that GE (5 mg/g Drosophila media)-treated Drosophila possessed a longer lifespan, better locomotor function, and less-degenerated ommatidia when compared with the A beta -expressing control (all P < 0.05). In vitro studies illustrated that GE increased the cell viability of A beta -treated PC12 cells in dose-dependent manner, probably through attenuation of A beta -induced oxidative and apoptotic stress.

Using genetics and pharmacology we have established that Abeta plays an important role in regulating capillary bed density within the brain, a function that is distinct from other cleavage products of amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP-deficient zebrafish had fewer cerebrovascular branches and shorter vessels in the hindbrain than wild-type embryos; this phenotype was rescued by treatment with human Abeta peptide, but not a smaller APP fragment called p3. Similar vascular defects were seen in zebrafish treated with a beta-secretase inhibitor (BSI) that blocked endogenous Abeta production. BSI-induced vascular defects were also improved by treatment with human Abeta, but not p3. Our results demonstrate a direct correlation between extracellular levels of Abeta and cerebrovascular density in the developing hindbrain. These findings may be relevant to AD etiology where high levels of Abeta in the brain parenchyma precede the development of neuritic plaques and dense aberrantly-branched blood vessel networks that appear between them. The ability of Abeta to modify blood vessels may coordinate capillary density with local metabolic activity, which could explain the evolutionary conservation of this peptide from lobe-finned fish to man.\", '']\n",

Previous studies demonstrate that Abeta is a suitable substrate for glycation, producing one form of the advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). We speculated that Abeta-AGE formation may exacerbate the neurotoxicity. To explore whether the Abeta-AGE is more toxic than the authentic Abeta and to understand the molecular mechanisms, we synthesized glycated Abeta by incubating Abeta with methylglyoxal (MG) in vitro and identified the formation of glycated Abeta by fluorescence spectrophotometer. Then, we treated the primary hippocampal neurons cultured 8 days in vitro with Abeta-AGE or Abeta for 24 h. We observed that glycation exacerbated neurotoxicity of Abeta with upregulation of receptor for AGE (RAGE) and activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), whereas simultaneous application of RAGE antibody or GSK-3 inhibitor reversed the neuronal damages aggravated by glycated Abeta. Thereafter, we found that Abeta is also glycated with an age-dependent elevation of AGEs in Tg2576 mice, whereas inhibition of Abeta-AGE formation by subcutaneously infusion of aminoguanidine for 3 months significantly rescued the early cognitive deficit in mice. Our data reveal for the first time that the glycated Abeta is more toxic. We propose that the glycated Abeta with the altered secondary structure may be a more suitable ligand than Abeta for RAGE and subsequent activation of GSK-3 that can lead to cascade pathologies of AD, therefore glycated Abeta may be a new therapeutic target for AD.\", '']\n",

Pretreatment of cells with D diminished intracellular generation of ROS in response to A beta 25 35. Western blot revealed that D significantly increased the expression and activity of HO-1, which was correlated with its protection against A beta 25 35-induced injury. Addition of ZnPP, an HO-1 competitive inhibitor, significantly attenuated its protective effect in A beta 25 35-treated cells, indicating the vital role of HO-1 resistance to oxidative injury.

Although the exact cause or causes remain unknown, emerging evidence suggests that impairments in the clearance of Abeta, after it is produced, may underlie the vast majority of sporadic AD cases. This review focuses on Abeta-degrading proteases (AbetaDPs), which have emerged as particularly important mediators of Abeta clearance. A wide variety of proteases that - by virtue of their particular regional and subcellular localization profiles - define distinct pools of Abeta have been identified. Different pools of Abeta, in turn, may contribute differentially to the pathogenesis of the disease.

We review the contribution of research in brain volume and of APP to the anabolic hypothesis, and relate APP to other proteins and pathways that have already been directly associated with autism, such as fragile X mental retardation protein, Ras small GTPase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and phosphoinositide 3 kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin.

Previously we have identified scavenger receptor class A (SR-A) of microglia mediates oligomeric amyloid-beta peptide (oAbeta) internalization by siRNA approach. SR-A is a member of cysteine-rich domain (SRCR) superfamily which contains proteins actively modulating the innate immunity and host defense, however the functions of the SRCR domain remain unclear. Whether the SRCR domain of SR-AI modulates the receptor surface targeting and ligand internalization was investigated by expressing truncated SR-A variants in COS-7 cells. Surface targeting of SR-A variants was examined by live immunostaining and surface biotinylation assays. Transfected COS-7 cells were incubated with fluorescent oAbeta and acetylated LDL (AcLDL) to assess their ligand-internalization capabilities. RESULT: Genetic ablation of SR-A attenuated the internalization of oAbeta and AcLDL by microglia. Half of oAbeta-containing endocytic vesicles was SR-A positive in both microglia and macrophages. Clathrin and dynamin in SR-AI-mediated oAbeta internalization were involved. The SRCR domain of SR-AI is encoded by exons 10 and 11. SR-A variants with truncated exon 11 were intracellularly retained, whereas SR-A variants with further truncations into exon 10 were surface-targeted. The fusion of exon 11 to the surface-targeted SR-A variant lacking the SRCR domain resulted in the intracellular retention and the co-immunoprecipitation of Bip chaperon of the endoplasmic reticulum. Surface-targeted variants were N-glycosylated, whereas intracellularly-retained variants retained in high-mannose states. In addition to the collagenous domain, the SRCR domain is a functional binding domain for oAbeta and AcLDL. Our data suggest that inefficient folding of SR-AI variants with truncated SRCR domain was recognized by the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation which leads to the immature N- glycosylation and intracellular retention. CONCLUSION: The novel functions of the SRCR domain on regulating the efficacy of receptor trafficking and ligand binding may lead to possible approaches on modulating the innate immunity in Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis.\", '']\n",

Current treatments for AD leave much to be desired, and numerous research efforts around the globe are focused on developing improved therapeutics. In addition, current diagnostic tools for AD rely largely on subjective cognitive assessment rather than on identification of pathophysiological changes associated with disease onset and progression. These facts have led to numerous efforts to develop chemical probes to detect pathophysiological hallmarks of AD, such as amyloid-beta plaques, for diagnosis and monitoring of therapeutic efficacy. This review provides a survey of chemical probes developed to date for AD with emphasis on synthetic methodologies and structure-activity relationships with regards to affinity for target and brain kinetics. Several probes discussed herein show particularly promising results and will be of immense value moving forward in the fight against AD.\", '']\n",

      "['3749817;23983461;Minocycline alleviates beta-amyloid protein and tau pathology via restraining neuroinflammation induced by diabetic metabolic disorder;Cai, Z., et al.;2013;', \"BACKGROUND: Compelling evidence has shown that diabetic metabolic disorder plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, including increased expression of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) and tau protein. Evidence has supported that minocycline, a tetracycline derivative, protects against neuroinflammation induced by neurodegenerative disorders or cerebral ischemia. This study has evaluated minocycline influence on expression of Abeta protein, tau phosphorylation, and inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) in the brain of diabetic rats to clarify neuroprotection by minocycline under diabetic metabolic disorder. METHOD: An animal model of diabetes was established by high fat diet and intraperitoneal injection of streptozocin. In this study, we investigated the effect of minocycline on expression of Abeta protein, tau phosphorylation, and inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) in the hippocampus of diabetic rats via immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: These results showed that minocycline decreased expression of Abeta protein and lowered the phosphorylation of tau protein, and retarded the proinflammatory cytokines, but not amyloid precursor protein. CONCLUSION: On the basis of the finding that minocycline had no influence on amyloid precursor protein and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 which determines the speed of Abeta generation, the decreases in Abeta production and tau hyperphosphorylation by minocycline are through inhibiting neuroinflammation, which contributes to Abeta production and tau hyperphosphorylation. Minocycline may also lower the self-perpetuating cycle between neuroinflammation and the pathogenesis of tau and Abeta to act as a neuroprotector. Therefore, the ability of minocycline to modulate inflammatory reactions may be of great importance in the selection of neuroprotective agents, especially in chronic conditions like diabetes and Alzheimer's disease.\", '']\n",

Cortical beta-amyloid plaques, the first stage of AD pathology, can be detected in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET), and several studies have shown that approximately 1/3 of healthy elderly have significant beta-amyloid deposition. Here we assessed whether asymptomatic amyloid-PET-positive controls have increased rates of brain atrophy, which could be harnessed as an outcome measure for AD prevention trials. We assessed 66 control subjects (age = 73.5+/-7.3 yrs; MMSE = 29+/-1.3) from the Australian Imaging Biomarkers & Lifestyle study who had a baseline Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET scan and two 3T MRI scans approximately 18-months apart. We calculated PET standard uptake value ratios (SUVR), and classified individuals as amyloid-positive/negative. Baseline and 18-month MRI scans were registered, and brain, hippocampal, and ventricular volumes and annualized volume changes calculated. Increasing baseline PiB-PET measures of beta-amyloid load correlated with hippocampal atrophy rate independent of age (p = 0.014). Twenty-two (1/3) were PiB-positive (SUVR>1.40), the remaining 44 PiB-negative (SUVR</=1.31). Compared to PiB-negatives, PiB-positive individuals were older (76.8+/-7.5 vs. 71.7+/-7.5, p<0.05) and more were APOE4 positive (63.6% vs. 19.2%, p<0.01) but there were no differences in baseline brain, ventricle or hippocampal volumes, either with or without correction for total intracranial volume, once age and gender were accounted for. The PiB-positive group had greater total hippocampal loss (0.06+/-0.08 vs. 0.02+/-0.05 ml/yr, p = 0.02), independent of age and gender, with non-significantly higher rates of whole brain (7.1+/-9.4 vs. 4.7+/-5.5 ml/yr) and ventricular (2.0+/-3.0 vs. 1.1+/-1.0 ml/yr) change. Based on the observed effect size, recruiting 384 (95%CI 195-1080) amyloid-positive subjects/arm will provide 80% power to detect 25% absolute slowing of hippocampal atrophy rate in an 18-month treatment trial. We conclude that hippocampal atrophy may be a feasible outcome measure for secondary prevention studies in asymptomatic amyloidosis.', '']\n",

In light of this, we developed a set of isoform specific absolute quantification real time PCR standards that allow for quantification of transcript copy numbers for total AbetaPP and all three major isoforms (AbetaPP695, AbetaPP751, and AbetaPP770) in addition to glyceraldehyde-3-dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and examined expression patterns in superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and cerebellar samples from patients with (n = 12) and without AD (n = 10).

Inheritance of the apoE4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. However, there is no consensus on how different apoE isotypes contribute to AD pathogenesis. It has been hypothesized that apoE and apoE4 in particular is an amyloid catalyst or \"pathological chaperone\". Alternatively it has been posited that apoE regulates Abeta clearance, with apoE4 been worse at this function compared to apoE3. These views seem fundamentally opposed. The former would indicate that removing apoE will reduce AD pathology, while the latter suggests increasing brain ApoE levels may be beneficial. Here we consider the scientific basis of these different models of apoE function and suggest that these seemingly opposing views can be reconciled. The optimal therapeutic target may be to inhibit the interaction of apoE with Abeta rather than altering apoE levels. Such an approach will not have detrimental effects on the many beneficial roles apoE plays in neurobiology.

Ease of culturing and a short life cycle make this animal model well suited to rapid screening of candidate compounds. RESULTS: We have generated a new transgenic strain of C. elegans that expresses full length Ass(1)(-)(4)(2). This strain differs from existing Ass models that predominantly express amino-truncated Ass(3)(-)(4)(2). The Ass(1)(-)(4)(2) is expressed in body wall muscle cells, where it oligomerizes, aggregates and results in severe, and fully penetrant, age progressive-paralysis. The in vivo accumulation of Ass(1)(-)(4)(2) also stains positive for amyloid dyes, consistent with in vivo fibril formation. The utility of this model for identification of potential protective compounds was examined using the investigational Alzheimer's therapeutic PBT2, shown to be neuroprotective in mouse models of AD and significantly improve cognition in AD patients.

To test whether pathology initiating in the EC spreads through the brain along synaptically connected circuits, we have generated a transgenic mouse model that differentially expresses pathological human tau in the EC and we have examined the distribution of tau pathology at different timepoints. In relatively young mice (10-11 months old), human tau was present in some cell bodies, but it was mostly observed in axons within the superficial layers of the medial and lateral EC, and at the terminal zones of the perforant pathway. In old mice (>22 months old), intense human tau immunoreactivity was readily detected not only in neurons in the superficial layers of the EC, but also in the subiculum, a substantial number of hippocampal pyramidal neurons especially in CA1, and in dentate gyrus granule cells. Scattered immunoreactive neurons were also seen in the deeper layers of the EC and in perirhinal and secondary somatosensory cortex. Immunoreactivity with the conformation-specific tau antibody MC1 correlated with the accumulation of argyrophilic material seen in old, but not young mice. In old mice, axonal human tau immunoreactivity, especially at the endzones of the perforant pathway, was greatly reduced. Relocalization of tau from axons to somatodendritic compartments and propagation of tauopathy to regions outside of the EC correlated with mature tangle formation in neurons in the EC as revealed by thioflavin-S staining. Our data demonstrate propagation of pathology from the EC and support a trans-synaptic mechanism of spread along anatomically connected networks, between connected and vulnerable neurons. In general, the mouse recapitulates the tauopathy that defines the early stages of AD and provides a model for testing mechanisms and functional outcomes associated with disease progression.\", '']\n",

Unexplained discrepancies observed between detectable PrPres and infectivity levels exemplify the complexity in deciphering the exact biophysical nature of prions and those host cell factors, if any, which contribute to transmission efficiency. In order to improve our understanding of these important issues, this study utilized a bioassay validated cell culture model of prion infection to investigate discordance between PrPres levels and infectivity titres at a subcellular resolution. FINDINGS: Subcellular fractions enriched in lipid rafts or endoplasmic reticulum/mitochondrial marker proteins were equally highly efficient at prion transmission, despite lipid raft fractions containing up to eight times the levels of detectable PrPres. Brain homogenate infectivity was not differentially enhanced by subcellular fraction-specific co-factors, and proteinase K pre-treatment of selected fractions modestly, but equally reduced infectivity. Only lipid raft associated infectivity was enhanced by sonication. CONCLUSIONS: This study authenticates a subcellular disparity in PrPres and infectivity levels, and eliminates simultaneous divergence of prion strains as the explanation for this phenomenon. On balance, the results align best with the concept that transmission efficiency is influenced more by intrinsic characteristics of the infectious prion, rather than cellular microenvironment conditions or absolute PrPres levels.\", '']\n",

Recently, an early clinical diagnosis has been considered a great importance in identifying people who are at high risk of AD. However, no microscale electronic sensing devices for the detection of Abeta peptides have been developed yet. In this study, we propose an effective method to evaluate a small quantity of Abeta peptides labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC] using a photosensitive field-effect transistor [p-FET] with an on-chip single-layer optical filter. To accurately evaluate the quantity of Abeta peptides within the cells cultured on the p-FET device, we measured the photocurrents which resulted from the FITC-conjugated Abeta peptides expressed from the cells and measured the number of photons of the fluorochrome in the cells using a photomultiplier tube. Thus, we evaluated the correlation between the generated photocurrents and the number of emitted photons. We also evaluated the correlation between the number of emitted photons and the amount of FITC by measuring the FITC volume using AFM. Finally, we estimated the quantity of Abeta peptides of the cells placed on the p-FET sensing area on the basis of the binding ratio between FITC molecules and Abeta peptides.\", '']\n",

In this study, we quantitated Abeta40 and Abeta42 in human RBCs with ELISA assays, and provided evidence that significant amounts of Abeta could be detected in RBCs and that the RBC Abeta levels increased with aging. The RBC Abeta levels increased with aging. On the other hand, providing an antioxidant supplement (astaxanthin, a polar carotenoid) to humans was found to decrease RBC Abeta as well as oxidative stress marker levels. These results suggest that plasma Abeta40 and Abeta42 bind to RBCs (possibly with aging), implying a pathogenic role of RBC Abeta.

Abeta is also deposited in the walls of cerebral blood vessels in many cases of AD. A substantial proportion of the Abeta that accumulates in the AD brain is deposited as Amyloid, which is highly insoluble, proteinaceous material with a beta-pleated-sheet conformation and deposited extracellularly in the form of 5-10 nm wide straight fibrils. As gamma-secretase catalyzes the final cleavage that releases the Abeta42 or 40 from amyloid beta -protein precursor (APP), therefore, it is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AD. gamma-Secretase cleavage is performed by a high molecular weight protein complex containing presenilins (PSs), nicastrin, Aph-1 and Pen-2. Previous studies have demonstrated that the presenilins (PS1 and PS2) are critical components of a large enzyme complex that performs gamma-secretase cleavage. METHODS: In this study we used RNA interference (RNAi) technology to examine the effects of small-interfering RNA (siRNA) against PS1 on expression levels of PS1 and Abeta42 in IMR-32 Cells using RTPCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence techniques.

Many studies have examined brain imaging or cerebrospinal fluid but there is also growing interest in blood biomarkers. The Alzheimer\\'s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has generated data on 190 plasma analytes in 566 individuals with MCI, AD or normal cognition. We conducted independent analyses of this dataset to identify plasma protein signatures predicting pre-clinical AD. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We focused on identifying signatures that discriminate cognitively normal controls (n = 54) from individuals with MCI who subsequently progress to AD (n = 163). Based on p value, apolipoprotein E (APOE) showed the strongest difference between these groups (p = 2.3x10(-13)). We applied a multivariate approach based on combinatorial optimization ((alpha,beta)-k Feature Set Selection), which retains information about individual participants and maintains the context of interrelationships between different analytes, to identify the optimal set of analytes (signature) to discriminate these two groups. We identified 11-analyte signatures achieving values of sensitivity and specificity between 65% and 86% for both MCI and AD groups, depending on whether APOE was included and other factors. Classification accuracy was improved by considering \"meta-features,\" representing the difference in relative abundance of two analytes, with an 8-meta-feature signature consistently achieving sensitivity and specificity both over 85%. Generating signatures based on longitudinal rather than cross-sectional data further improved classification accuracy, returning sensitivities and specificities of approximately 90%. CONCLUSIONS: Applying these novel analysis approaches to the powerful and well-characterized ADNI dataset has identified sets of plasma biomarkers for pre-clinical AD.

Here, we examined longitudinal rates of change as a function of baseline age for measures of clinical decline and structural MRI-based regional brain atrophy, in cohorts of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively healthy (HC) individuals aged 65 to 90 years (total n = 723). The effect of age was modeled using mixed effects linear regression. There was pronounced reduction in rates of clinical decline and atrophy with age for AD and MCI individuals, whereas HCs showed increased rates of clinical decline and atrophy with age. This resulted in convergence in rates of change for HCs and patients with advancing age for several measures. Baseline cerebrospinal fluid densities of AD-relevant proteins, Abeta(1-42), tau, and phospho-tau(181p) (ptau), showed a similar pattern of convergence with advanced age across cohorts, particularly for ptau. In contrast, baseline clinical measures did not differ by age, indicating uniformity of clinical severity at baseline. These results imply that the phenotypic expression of AD is relatively mild in individuals older than approximately 85 years, and this may affect the ability to distinguish AD from normal aging in the very old.

Targeted replacement (TR) mice expressing the human APOE3 (TRE3) or APOE4 (TRE4) genes and wildtype mice received intracerebral injections of human Abeta(40). Abeta(40) aggregated in peri-arterial drainage pathways in TRE4 mice, but not in TRE3 or wildtype mice.

Immunocytochemical and Western blot analysis of vascular basement membrane proteins demonstrated significantly raised levels of collagen IV in 3-month-old TRE4 mice compared with TRE3 and wild type mice. In 16-month-old mice, collagen IV and laminin levels were unchanged between wild type and TRE3 mice, but were lower in TRE4 mice.

CONCLUSIONS: We confirm that Abeta40 is the most abundant Abeta species, and we propose a model in which CSF p3-Alcalpha can serve as a either (1) a nonaggregatable surrogate marker for gamma-secretase activity; (2) as a marker for clearance of transmembrane domain peptides derived from integral protein catabolism; or (3) both. We propose the specification of an MCI/SAD endophenotype characterized by co-elevation of levels of both CSF p3-Alcalpha and Abeta40, and we propose that subjects in this category might be especially responsive to therapeutics aimed at modulation of gamma-secretase function and/or transmembrane domain peptide clearance.

Our goal was to construct multivalent foldamer-dendrimer conjugates which wrap the synaptotoxic beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomers with high affinity through their helical foldamer tentacles. Oligomeric Abeta species play pivotal role in Alzheimer's disease, therefore recognition and direct inhibition of this undruggable target is a great current challenge. METHODS AND RESULTS: Short helical beta-peptide foldamers with designed secondary structures and side chain chemistry patterns were applied as potential recognition segments and their binding to the target was tested with NMR methods (saturation transfer difference and transferred-nuclear Overhauser effect). Helices exhibiting binding in the microM region were coupled to a tetravalent G0-PAMAM dendrimer. In vitro biophysical (isothermal titration calorimetry, dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and size-exclusion chromatography) and biochemical tests (ELISA and dot blot) indicated the tight binding between the foldamer conjugates and the Abeta oligomers. Moreover, a selective low nM interaction with the low molecular weight fraction of the Abeta oligomers was found. Ex vivo electrophysiological experiments revealed that the new material rescues the long-term potentiation from the toxic Abeta oligomers in mouse hippocampal slices at submicromolar concentration.

T., et al.;2012;\", \"BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence indicates that inflammation is one of the earliest neuropathological events in Alzheimer's disease. Accordingly, we have recently shown the occurrence of an early, pro-inflammatory reaction in the hippocampus of young, three-month-old transgenic McGill-Thy1-APP mice in the absence of amyloid plaques but associated with intracellular accumulation of amyloid beta petide oligomers. The role of such a pro-inflammatory process in the progression of the pathology remained to be elucidated. METHODS AND RESULTS: To clarify this we administered minocycline, a tetracyclic derivative with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, to young, pre-plaque McGill-Thy1-APP mice for one month. The treatment ended at the age of three months, when the mice were still devoid of plaques. Minocycline treatment corrected the up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 observed in young transgenic placebo mice. Furthermore, the down-regulation of inflammatory markers correlated with a reduction in amyloid precursor protein levels and amyloid precursor protein-related products. Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 activity and levels were found to be up-regulated in transgenic placebo mice, while minocycline treatment restored these levels to normality. The anti-inflammatory and beta-secretase 1 effects could be partly explained by the inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa B pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the pharmacological modulation of neuroinflammation might represent a promising approach for preventing or delaying the development of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology at its initial, pre-clinical stages. The results open new vistas to the interplay between inflammation and amyloid pathology.\", '']\n",

Abeta is a peptide of 38-43 amino acids and its accumulation and aggregation plays a key role early in the disease. A large fraction of beta amyloid is N-terminally truncated rendering a glutamine that can subsequently be cyclized into pyroglutamate (pE). This makes the peptide more resistant to proteases, more prone to aggregation and increases its neurotoxicity. The enzyme glutaminyl cyclase (QC) catalyzes this conversion of glutamine to pE. In brains of AD patients, the expression of QC is increased in the earliest stages of pathology, which may be an important event in the pathogenesis. In this study we aimed to investigate the regulatory mechanism underlying the upregulation of QC expression in AD. Using differentiated SK-N-SH as a neuronal cell model, we found that neither the presence of Abeta peptides nor the unfolded protein response, two early events in AD, leads to increased QC levels. In contrast, we demonstrated increased QC mRNA levels and enzyme activity in response to another pathogenic factor in AD, perturbed intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis. The QC promoter contains a putative binding site for the Ca(2+) dependent transcription factors c-fos and c-jun. C-fos and c-jun are induced by the same Ca(2+)-related stimuli as QC and their upregulation precedes QC expression. We show that in the human brain QC is predominantly expressed by neurons. Interestingly, the Ca(2+)- dependent regulation of both c-fos and QC is not observed in non-neuronal cells. Our results indicate that perturbed Ca(2+) homeostasis results in upregulation of QC selectively in neuronal cells via Ca(2+)- dependent transcription factors. This suggests that disruption of Ca(2+) homeostasis may contribute to the formation of the neurotoxic pE Abeta peptides in Alzheimer's disease.\", '']\n",

V., et al.;2012;', \"BACKGROUND: Older adults free of dementia but with subjective memory complaints (SMC) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are considered at increased risk of cognitive decline. Vascular risk factors (VRF), including hypertension, heart disease, smoking, hypercholesterolemia and lack of physical activity (PA) have been identified as modifiable risk factors contributing to cognitive decline, and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) are associated with VRF, SMC and cognitive impairment. Findings from a growing number of clinical trials with older adults are providing strong evidence for the benefits of physical activity for maintaining cognitive function, but few studies are investigating these benefits in high-risk populations. The aim of AIBL Active is to determine whether a 24-month physical activity program can delay the progression of white matter changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS/DESIGN: This single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) is offered to 156 participants, aged 60 and older, in the Melbourne arm of the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Aging (AIBL). Participants must have SMC with or without MCI and at least one VRF. The PA intervention is a modification of the intervention previously trialed in older adults with SMC and MCI (Fitness for the Ageing Brain Study). It comprises 24 months of moderate, home-based PA (150 minutes per week) and a behavioral intervention package. The primary outcome measure will be change in WMH after 24 months on MRI. Cognition, quality of life, functional fitness, level of physical activity, plasma biomarkers for cerebrovascular disease and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging comprise secondary measures. DISCUSSION: Currently, there is no effective pharmacological treatment available to delay cognitive decline and dementia in older adults at risk. Should our findings show that physical activity can slow down the progression of WMH, this RCT would provide an important proof of concept. Since imbedded in AIBL this RCT will also be able to investigate the interaction between vascular and Alzheimer's disease pathologies.

We report sequence data for 439 probands from late-onset AD families with a history of four or more affected individuals. Sixty sequenced individuals (13.7%) carried a novel or pathogenic mutation. Eight pathogenic variants, (one each in APP and MAPT, two in PSEN1 and four in GRN) three of which are novel, were found in 14 samples. Thirteen additional variants, present in 23 families, did not segregate with disease, but the frequency of these variants is higher in AD cases than controls, indicating that these variants may also modify risk for disease. The frequency of rare variants in these genes in this series is significantly higher than in the 1,000 genome project (p = 5.09 x 10(-)(5); OR = 2.21; 95%CI = 1.49-3.28) or an unselected population of 12,481 samples (p = 6.82 x 10(-)(5); OR = 2.19; 95%CI = 1.347-3.26). Rare coding variants in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2, increase risk for or cause late onset AD. The presence of variants in these genes in LOAD and early-onset AD demonstrates that factors other than the mutation can impact the age at onset and penetrance of at least some variants associated with AD.

      "[\"3311647;22457776;The zinc dyshomeostasis hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease;Craddock, T. J., et al.;2012;\", \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. Hallmark AD neuropathology includes extracellular amyloid plaques composed largely of the amyloid-beta protein (Abeta), intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyper-phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau (MAP-tau), and microtubule destabilization. Early-onset autosomal dominant AD genes are associated with excessive Abeta accumulation, however cognitive impairment best correlates with NFTs and disrupted microtubules. The mechanisms linking Abeta and NFT pathologies in AD are unknown. Here, we propose that sequestration of zinc by Abeta-amyloid deposits (Abeta oligomers and plaques) not only drives Abeta aggregation, but also disrupts zinc homeostasis in zinc-enriched brain regions important for memory and vulnerable to AD pathology, resulting in intra-neuronal zinc levels, which are either too low, or excessively high. To evaluate this hypothesis, we 1) used molecular modeling of zinc binding to the microtubule component protein tubulin, identifying specific, high-affinity zinc binding sites that influence side-to-side tubulin interaction, the sensitive link in microtubule polymerization and stability. We also 2) performed kinetic modeling showing zinc distribution in extra-neuronal Abeta deposits can reduce intra-neuronal zinc binding to microtubules, destabilizing microtubules. Finally, we 3) used metallomic imaging mass spectrometry (MIMS) to show anatomically-localized and age-dependent zinc dyshomeostasis in specific brain regions of Tg2576 transgenic, mice, a model for AD. We found excess zinc in brain regions associated with memory processing and NFT pathology. Overall, we present a theoretical framework and support for a new theory of AD linking extra-neuronal Abeta amyloid to intra-neuronal NFTs and cognitive dysfunction. The connection, we propose, is based on beta-amyloid-induced alterations in zinc ion concentration inside neurons affecting stability of polymerized microtubules, their binding to MAP-tau, and molecular dynamics involved in cognition. Further, our theory supports novel AD therapeutic strategies targeting intra-neuronal zinc homeostasis and microtubule dynamics to prevent neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.\", '']\n",

Cellular and biochemical analysis reveal that this mutation increased Abeta production, Abeta42/40 ratio and prolonged Abeta42 oligomer state with higher neurotoxicity. Because the D7H mutant Abeta has an additional metal ion-coordinating residue, histidine, we speculate that this mutation may promote susceptibility of Abeta to ion. When co-incubated with Zn(2+) or Cu(2+), Abeta(D7H) aggregated into low molecular weight oligomers. Together, the D7H mutation could contribute to AD pathology through a \"double punch\" effect on elevating both Abeta production and oligomerization.

Recently, we reported that the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein growth arrest-specific 1 (Gas1) binds to and interferes with the maturation and processing of AbetaPP. Gas1 expression led to a trafficking blockade of AbetaPP between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi. GPI-anchored proteins can exit the ER by transiting through raft subdomains acting as specialized sorting platforms. Here, we show that Gas1 co-partitioned and formed a complex with AbetaPP in raft fractions, wherein Gas1 overexpression triggered immature AbetaPP accumulation. Pharmacological interference of ER to Golgi transport increased immature AbetaPP accumulation upon Gas1 expression in these raft fractions, which were found to be positive for the COPII protein complex component Sec31A, a specific marker for ER exit sites. Furthermore, a Gas1 mutant lacking the GPI anchor that could not transit through rafts was still able to form a complex with AbetaPP but did not lead to immature AbetaPP accumulation in rafts.

In view of the observation that apoE and its functional domains impact extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, we hypothesized that apoE could also confer protection against ECM degradation by mechanisms independent of its role in cholesterol and lipoprotein transport. The ECM degrading enzyme, heparanase, is secreted by cells as pro-heparanase that is internalized through low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) to become enzymatically active. Both apoE and pro-heparanase bind the LRP-1. We further hypothesized that an apoE mimetic peptide (apoEdp) would inhibit the production of active heparanase by blocking LRP-1-mediated uptake of pro-heparanase and thereby decrease degradation of the ECM. To test this hypothesis, we induced the expression of heparanase by incubating human retinal endothelial cells (hRECs) with high glucose (30 mM) for 72 hours. We found that elevated expression of heparanase by high glucose was associated with increased shedding of heparan sulfate (DeltaHS) and the tight junction protein occludin. Treatment of hRECs with 100 microM apoEdp in the presence of high glucose significantly reduced the expression of heparanase, shedding of DeltaHS, and loss of occludin as detected by Western blot analysis. Either eye drop treatment of 1% apoEdp topically 4 times a day for 14 consecutive days or intraperitoneal injection (40 mg/kg) of apoEdp daily for 14 consecutive days in an in vivo mouse model of streptozotocin-induced diabetes inhibited the loss of tight junction proteins occludin and zona occludin- 1 (ZO-1). These findings imply a functional relationship between apoE and endothelial cell matrix because the deregulation of these molecules can be inhibited by a short peptide derived from the receptor-binding region of apoE.

Proposed functions of these vesicles include roles in cell-cell signaling, removal of unwanted proteins, and the transfer of pathogens between cells. One such pathogen which exploits this pathway is the prion, the infectious particle responsible for the transmissible neurodegenerative diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) of humans or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) of cattle.

Exosomes have been shown to contain full-length APP and several distinct proteolytically cleaved products of APP, including Abeta. In addition, these fragments can be modulated using inhibitors of the proteases involved in APP cleavage. These observations provide further evidence for a novel pathway in which PrP and APP fragments are released from cells.

Also, vasogenic edema was reported in phase 2 of a passive immunization clinical trial. In order to overcome these vascular adverse effects it is critical that we understand the mechanism(s) by which they occur. Methods: We have examined the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) protein degradation system in two previously published anti-A beta immunotherapy studies. The first was a passive immunization study in which we examined 22 month old APPSw mice that had received anti-A beta antibodies for 1, 2 or 3 months.

Results: There is a significant activation of the MMP2 and MMP9 proteinase degradation systems by anti-A beta immunotherapy, regardless of whether this is delivered through active vaccination or passive immunization. We have characterized this activation by gene expression, protein expression and zymography assessment of MMP activity. Conclusions: Since the MMP2 and MMP9 systems are heavily implicated in the pathophysiology of intracerbral hemorrhage, these data may provide a potential mechanism of microhemorrhage due to immunotherapy. Increased activity of the MMP system, therefore, is likely to be a major factor in increased microhemorrhage occurrence.\", '']\n",

Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is absent or expressed at substantially reduced levels in FXS, binds to and controls the postsynaptic translation of amyloid beta-protein precursor (AbetaPP) mRNA. Cleavage of AbetaPP can produce beta-amyloid (Abeta), a 39-43 amino acid peptide mis-expressed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down syndrome (DS). Abeta is over-expressed in the brain of Fmr1(KO) mice, suggesting a pathogenic role in FXS. To determine if genetic reduction of AbetaPP/Abeta rescues characteristic FXS phenotypes, we assessed audiogenic seizures (AGS), anxiety, the ratio of mature versus immature dendritic spines and metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-mediated long-term depression (LTD) in Fmr1(KO) mice after removal of one App allele. All of these phenotypes were partially or completely reverted to normal. Plasma Abeta(1-42) was significantly reduced in full-mutation FXS males compared to age-matched controls while cortical and hippocampal levels were somewhat increased, suggesting that Abeta is sequestered in the brain. Evolving therapies directed at reducing Abeta in AD may be applicable to FXS and Abeta may serve as a plasma-based biomarker to facilitate disease diagnosis or assess therapeutic efficacy.\", '']\n",

Illumina RNA-Seq analysis was used to survey transcriptome profiles from total brain, frontal and temporal lobe of healthy and AD post-mortem tissue. We quantified gene expression levels, splicing isoforms and alternative transcript start sites. Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis revealed an overrepresentation of genes associated with a neuron's cytological structure and synapse function in AD brain samples. Analysis of the temporal lobe with the Cufflinks tool revealed that transcriptional isoforms of the apolipoprotein E gene, APOE-001, -002 and -005, are under the control of different promoters in normal and AD brain tissue. We also observed differing expression levels of APOE-001 and -002 splice variants in the AD temporal lobe.

Using gel based proteomics we previously identified seven plasma proteins that were significantly associated with hippocampal volume in a combined cohort of subjects with AD (N = 27) and MCI (N = 17).

We confirmed that plasma concentrations of five proteins, together with age and sex, explained more than 35% of variance in whole brain volume in AD patients. These proteins are complement components C3 and C3a, complement factor-I, gamma-fibrinogen and alpha-1-microglobulin.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a cross-sectional study including patients with ALS (N = 68) with clinical follow-up data over 6 months, Parkinson's disease (PD, N = 20), and age-matched controls (N = 40), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of sAPPalpha a, sAPPss and neurofilaments (NfH(SMI35)) were measured by multiplex assay, Progranulin by ELISA. CSF sAPPalpha and sAPPss levels were lower in ALS with a rapidly-progressive disease course (p = 0.03, and p = 0.02) and with longer disease duration (p = 0.01 and p = 0.01, respectively). CSF NfH(SMI35) was elevated in ALS compared to PD and controls, with highest concentrations found in patients with rapid disease progression (p<0.01). High CSF NfH(SMI3) was linked to low CSF sAPPalpha and sAPPss (p = 0.001, and p = 0.007, respectively). The ratios CSF NfH(SMI35)/CSF sAPPalpha,-ss were elevated in patients with fast progression of disease (p = 0.002 each). CSF Progranulin decreased with ongoing disease (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new CSF candidate markers associated with progression of disease in ALS. The data suggest that a deficiency of cellular neuroprotective mechanisms (decrease of sAPP) is linked to progressive neuro-axonal damage (increase of NfH(SMI35)) and to progression of disease.\", '']\n",

We have used brain imaging and other measurements to track some of the earliest changes associated with the predisposition to AD. We have proposed the Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative (API) to evaluate investigational amyloid-modifying treatments in healthy people who, based on their age and genetic background, are at the highest imminent risk of developing symptomatic AD using brain imaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and cognitive endpoints.

In another trial, we propose to study apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 homozygotes (and possibly heterozygotes) close to their estimated average age at clinical onset. The API has several goals: 1) to evaluate investigational AD-modifying treatments sooner than otherwise possible; 2) to determine the extent to which the treatment's brain imaging and other biomarker effects predict a clinical benefit-information needed to help qualify biomarker endpoints for use in pivotal prevention trials; 3) to provide a better test of the amyloid hypothesis than clinical trials in symptomatic patients, when these treatments may be too little too late to exert their most profound effect; 4) to establish AD prevention registries needed to support these and other presymptomatic AD trials; and 5) to give those individuals at highest imminent risk of AD symptoms access to the most promising investigational treatments in clinical trials.\", '']\n",

At the baseline assessment, the subjects enrolled in the study were classified into three diagnostic groups: healthy controls (n=46), MCI (n=143) and AD (n=47). Among the MCI subjects, 52 progressed to AD in the follow-up. Comprehensive metabolomics approach was applied to analyze baseline serum samples and to associate the metabolite profiles with the diagnosis at baseline and in the follow-up. At baseline, AD patients were characterized by diminished ether phospholipids, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins and sterols. A molecular signature comprising three metabolites was identified, which was predictive of progression to AD in the follow-up. The major contributor to the predictive model was 2,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid, which was upregulated in AD progressors (P=0.0048), indicating potential involvement of hypoxia in the early AD pathogenesis. This was supported by the pathway analysis of metabolomics data, which identified upregulation of pentose phosphate pathway in patients who later progressed to AD. Together, our findings primarily implicate hypoxia, oxidative stress, as well as membrane lipid remodeling in progression to AD. Establishment of pathogenic relevance of predictive biomarkers such as ours may not only facilitate early diagnosis, but may also help identify new therapeutic avenues.\", '']\n",

Here, we report the effects of interfaces formed by medium-chain (C9-C12), saturated non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) on Abeta42 aggregation. NEFAs uniquely affected Abeta42 aggregation rates that depended on both the ratio of Abeta:NEFA as well the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the NEFAs. More importantly, irrespective of the kind of NEFA used, we observed that two distinct oligomers, 12-18 mers and 4-5 mers were formed via different pathway of aggregation under specific experimental conditions: (i) 12-18 mers were generated near the CMC in which NEFAs augment the rate of Abeta42 aggregation towards fibril formation, and, (ii) 4-5 mers were formed above the CMC, where NEFAs inhibit fibril formation. The data indicated that both 12-18 mers and 4-5 mers are formed along an alternate pathway called 'off-pathway' that did not result in fibril formation and yet have subtle structural and morphological differences that distinguish their bulk molecular behavior. These observations, (i) reflect the possible mechanism of Abeta aggregation in physiological lipid-rich environments, and (ii) reiterate the fact that all oligomeric forms of Abeta need not be obligatory intermediates of the fibril formation pathway.\", '']\n",

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we provide data supporting an in vivo function for Abeta as an antimicrobial peptide (AMP). Experiments used established in vitro assays to compare antimicrobial activities of Abeta and LL-37, an archetypical human AMP. Findings reveal that Abeta exerts antimicrobial activity against eight common and clinically relevant microorganisms with a potency equivalent to, and in some cases greater than, LL-37. Furthermore, we show that AD whole brain homogenates have significantly higher antimicrobial activity than aged matched non-AD samples and that AMP action correlates with tissue Abeta levels. Consistent with Abeta-mediated activity, the increased antimicrobial action was ablated by immunodepletion of AD brain homogenates with anti-Abeta antibodies. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest Abeta is a hitherto unrecognized AMP that may normally function in the innate immune system.

CP-690,550 is a potent and selective JAK inhibitor currently in clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other autoimmune disease indications. In RA trials, dose-dependent decreases in neutrophil counts (PBNC) were observed with CP-690,550 treatment. These studies were undertaken to better understand the relationship between JAK selectivity and PBNC decreases observed with CP-690,550 treatment. METHODS: Potency and selectivity of CP-690,550 for mouse, rat and human JAKs was evaluated in a panel of in vitro assays. The effect of CP-690,550 on granulopoiesis from progenitor cells was also assessed in vitro using colony forming assays. In vivo the potency of orally administered CP-690,550 on arthritis (paw edema), plasma cytokines, PBNC and bone marrow differentials were evaluated in the rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) model. RESULTS: CP-690,550 potently inhibited signaling through JAK1 and JAK3 with 5-100 fold selectivity over JAK2 in cellular assays, despite inhibiting all four JAK isoforms with nM potency in in vitro enzyme assays. Dose-dependent inhibition of paw edema was observed in vivo with CP-690,550 treatment. Plasma cytokines (IL-6 and IL-17), PBNC, and bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells were elevated in the context of AIA disease. At efficacious exposures, CP-690,550 returned all of these parameters to pre-disease levels. The plasma concentration of CP-690,550 at efficacious doses was above the in vitro whole blood IC50 of JAK1 and JAK3 inhibition, but not that of JAK2. CONCLUSION: Results from this investigation suggest that CP-690,550 is a potent inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK3 with potentially reduced cellular potency for JAK2. In rat AIA, as in the case of human RA, PBNC were decreased at efficacious exposures of CP-690,550. Inflammatory end points were similarly reduced, as judged by attenuation of paw edema and cytokines IL-6 and IL-17. Plasma concentration at these exposures was consistent with inhibition of JAK1 and JAK3 but not JAK2. Decreases in PBNC following CP-690,550 treatment may thus be related to attenuation of inflammation and are likely not due to suppression of granulopoiesis through JAK2 inhibition.', '']\n",

N., et al.;2009;', \"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The amyloid beta-peptide is a ubiquitous peptide, which is prone to aggregate forming soluble toxic oligomers and insoluble less-toxic aggregates. The intrinsic and external/environmental factors that determine Abeta aggregation in vivo are poorly understood, as well as the cellular meaning of this process itself. Genetic data as well as cell biological and biochemical evidence strongly support the hypothesis that Abeta is a major player in the onset and development of Alzheimer's disease. In addition, it is also known that Abeta is involved in Inclusion Body Myositis, a common myopathy of the elderly in which the peptide accumulates intracellularly. RESULTS: In the present work, we found that intracellular Abeta aggregation in muscle cells of Caenorhabditis elegans overexpressing Abeta peptide is affected by two single amino acid substitutions, E22G (Arctic) and V18A (NIC). Both variations show decrease intracellular amyloidogenesis compared to wild type Abeta. We show that intracellular amyloid aggregation of wild type Abeta is accelerated by Cu2+ and diminished by copper chelators. Moreover, we demonstrate through toxicity and behavioral assays that Abeta-transgenic worms display a higher tolerance to Cu2+ toxic effects and that this resistance may be linked to the formation of amyloid aggregates. CONCLUSION: Our data show that intracellular Abeta amyloid aggregates may trap excess of free Cu2+ buffering its cytotoxic effects and that accelerated intracellular Abeta aggregation may be part of a cell protective mechanism.\", '']\n",

Previous studies have shown that treatment of young APP mice with specific inhibitors of gamma-secretase prevented formation of new plaques. It has not yet been shown directly whether existing plaques would be affected by gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment. Similarly, alterations in neuronal morphology in the immediate vicinity of plaques represent a plaque-specific neurotoxic effect. Reversal of these alterations is an important endpoint of successful therapy whether or not a treatment affects plaque size. In the present study we used longitudinal imaging in vivo with multiphoton microscopy to study the effects of the orally active gamma-secretase inhibitor LY-411575 in 10-11 month old APP:PS1 mice with established amyloid pathology and neuritic abnormalities. Neurons expressed YFP allowing fluorescent detection of morphology whereas plaques were labelled with methoxy-XO4. The same identified neurites and plaques were followed in weekly imaging sessions in living mice treated daily (5 mg/kg) for 3 weeks with the compound. Although LY-411575 reduced Abeta levels in plasma and brain, it did not have an effect on the size of existing plaques. There was also no effect on the abnormal neuritic curvature near plaques, or the dystrophies in very close proximity to senile plaques. Our results suggest that therapeutics aimed at inhibition of Abeta generation are less effective for reversal of existing plaques than for prevention of new plaque formation and have no effect on the plaque-mediated neuritic abnormalities, at least under these conditions where Abeta production is suppressed but not completely blocked. Therefore, a combination therapy of Abeta suppression with agents that increase clearance of amyloid and/or prevent neurotoxicity might be needed for a more effective treatment in patients with pre-existing pathology.\", '']\n",

APP695 co-immunoprecipitated with assembled NR1-1a NR2A and NR1-1a NR2B NMDA receptors following expression in mammalian cells. Single NR1-1a, NR1-2a, NR1-4bc-Myc or NR2 subunit transfections revealed that co-association of APP695 with assembled NMDA receptors was mediated via the NR1 subunit; it was independent of the NR1 C1, C2 and C2' cassettes and, the use of an NR1-2ac-Myc trafficking mutant suggested that interaction between the two proteins occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. The use of antibodies directed against extracellular and intracellular NR2 subunit epitopes for immunoprecipitations suggested that APP NMDA receptor association was mediated via N-terminal domains. Anti-APP antibodies immunoprecipitated NR1, NR2A and NR2B immunoreactive bands from detergent extracts of mammalian brain; reciprocally, anti-NR1 or anti-NR2A antibodies co-immunoprecipitated APP immunoreactivity. Immune pellets from brain were sensitive to endoglycosidase H suggesting that, as for heterologous expression, APP and NMDA receptor association occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. Co-expression of APP695 in mammalian cells resulted in enhanced cell surface expression of both NR1-1a NR2A and NR1-1a NR2B NMDA receptors with no increase in total subunit expression. These findings are further evidence for a role of APP in intracellular trafficking mechanisms. Further, they provide a link between two major brain proteins that have both been implicated in Alzheimer's disease.\", '']\n",

Recent studies suggest that Cu could be used as a novel target for cancer therapies. Clioquinol (CQ), an antibiotic that is able to form stable complexes with Cu or zinc (Zn), has shown proteasome-inhibitory, androgen receptor-suppressing, apoptosis-inducing, and antitumor activities in human cancer cells and xenografts. The mechanisms underlying the interaction of CQ with cellular Cu, the alteration of the Cu/Zn ratio and the antitumor role of CQ in vivo have not been fully elucidated. We report here that Cu accumulates in tumor tissue and that the Cu/Zn balances in tumor, but not normal, tissue change significantly after the treatment with CQ. Cu speciation analysis showed that the Cu(I) species is predominant in both normal and tumor tissues and that Cu(II) content was significantly increased in tumor, but not normal tissue after CQ treatment. Our findings indicate that CQ can interact with cellular Cu in vivo, dysregulates the Cu/Zn balance and is able to convert Cu(I) to Cu(II) in tumor tissue.

To our knowledge, the influence of Abeta on MTT reduction has never been tested in more complex tissue. Initially, we reproduced the disturbed MTT reduction in neuron and astroglia primary cell cultures from rats as well as in the BV2 microglia cell line, utilizing four different Abeta species, namely freshly dissolved Abeta (25-35), fibrillar Abeta (1-40), oligomeric Abeta (1-42) and oligomeric Abeta (1-40). In contrast to the findings in single cell cultures, none of these Abeta species altered MTT reduction in rat organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHC). Moreover, application of Abeta to acutely isolated hippocampal slices from adult rats and in vivo intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta also did not influence the MTT reduction in the respective tissue. Failure of Abeta penetration into the tissue cannot explain the differences between single cells and the more complex brain tissue. Thus electrophysiological investigations disclosed an impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices from rat by application of oligomeric Abeta (1-40), but not by freshly dissolved Abeta (25-35) or fibrillar Abeta (1-40). In conclusion, the experiments revealed a glaring discrepancy between single cell cultures and complex brain tissue regarding the effect of different Abeta species on MTT reduction. Particularly, the differential effect of oligomeric versus other Abeta forms on LTP was not reflected in the MTT reduction assay. This may indicate that the Abeta oligomer effect on synaptic function reflected by LTP impairment precedes changes in formazane formation rate or that cells embedded in a more natural environment in the tissue are less susceptible to damage by Abeta, raising cautions against the consideration of single cell MTT reduction activity as a reliable assay in Alzheimer's drug discovery studies.\", '']\n",

B., et al.;2008;', 'Overexpression of HER-2/Neu occurs in about 25-30% of breast cancer patients and is indicative of poor prognosis. While Her2/Neu overexpression is primarily a result of erbB2 amplification, it has recently been recognized that erbB2 levels are also regulated on the protein level. However, factors that regulate Her2/Neu protein stability are less well understood. The prolyl isomerase Pin1 catalyzes the isomerization of specific pSer/Thr-Pro motifs that have been phosphorylated in response to mitogenic signaling. We have previously reported that Pin1-catalyzed post-phosphorylational modification of signal transduction modulates the oncogenic pathways downstream from c-neu. The goal of this study was to examine the expression of prolyl isomerase Pin1 in human Her2+ breast cancer, and to study if Pin1 affects the expression of Her2/Neu itself. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry for Her2 and Pin1 were performed on two hundred twenty-three human breast cancers, with 59% of the specimen from primary cancers and 41% from metastatic sites. Pin1 inhibition was achieved using siRNA in Her2+ breast cancer cell lines, and its effects were studied using cell viability assays, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Sixty-four samples (28.7%) stained positive for Her2 (IHC 3+), and 54% (122/223) of all breast cancers stained positive for Pin1. Of the Her2-positive cancers 40 (62.5%) were also Pin1-positive, based on strong nuclear or nuclear and cytoplasmic staining. Inhibition of Pin1 via RNAi resulted in significant suppression of Her2-positive tumor cell growth in BT474, SKBR3 and AU565 cells. Pin1 inhibition greatly increased the sensitivity of Her2-positive breast cancer cells to the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin, while it did not increase their sensitivity to Trastuzumab, suggesting that Pin1 might act on Her2 signaling. We found that Pin1 interacted with the protein complex that contains ubiquitinated erbB2 and that Pin1 inhibition accelerated erbB2 degradation, which could be prevented by treatments with the proteasome inhibitor ALLnL. CONCLUSION: Pin1 is a novel regulator of erbB2 that modulates the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of erbB2. The overexpression of Pin1 in a majority of Her2-overexpressing breast cancer may contribute to maintain erbB2 levels. Pin1 inhibition alone and in conjunction with mTOR inhibition suppresses the growth of Her2+ breast cancer cells.', '']\n",

Since some epidemiological studies showed that EGb 761, an extract from the leaves of the Ginkgo biloba tree, had a beneficial effect on mild forms of AD, the effects of some of the major components of the EGb 761 extract (ginkgolides A and B, myricetin and quercetin) on synapse damage in response to Abeta1-42 were examined. RESULTS: The addition of Abeta1-42 to cortical or hippocampal neurons reduced the amounts of cell associated synaptophysin, a pre-synaptic membrane protein that is essential for neurotransmission, indicating synapse damage. The effects of Abeta1-42 on synapses were apparent at concentrations approximately 100 fold less than that required to kill neurons; the synaptophysin content of neuronal cultures was reduced by 50% by 50 nM Abeta1-42. Pre-treatment of cortical or hippocampal neuronal cultures with ginkgolides A or B, but not with myrecitin or quercetin, protected against Abeta1-42-induced loss of synaptophysin. This protective effect was achieved with nanomolar concentrations of ginkgolides. Previous studies indicated that the ginkgolides are platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonists and here we show that Abeta1-42-induced loss of synaptophysin from neuronal cultures was also reduced by pre-treatment with other PAF antagonists (Hexa-PAF and CV6209). PAF, but not lyso-PAF, mimicked the effects Abeta1-42 and caused a dose-dependent reduction in the synaptophysin content of neurons. This effect of PAF was greatly reduced by pre-treatment with ginkgolide B. In contrast, ginkgolide B did not affect the loss of synaptophysin in neurons incubated with prostaglandin E2. CONCLUSION: Pre-treatment with ginkgolides A or B protects neurons against Abeta1-42-induced synapse damage. These ginkgolides also reduced the effects of PAF, but not those of prostaglandin E2, on the synaptophysin content of neuronal cultures, results consistent with prior reports that ginkgolides act as PAF receptor antagonists. Such observations suggest that the ginkgolides are active components of Ginkgo biloba preparations and may protect against the synapse damage and the cognitive loss seen during the early stages of AD.\", '']\n",

In this study, we analyzed brain extracted CTFs in subjects with AD, non-AD control, and Down's syndrome (DS) cases. Our data indicate that: (i) In fetal DS subjects CTFs levels are increased in comparison to age-matched control, suggesting that the enhanced CTFs formation is important for the early occurrence of plaques deposition in DS. No significant difference in CTFs level is present between AD and age- matched control cases. (ii) CTFs modified at their N-terminus are the direct precursors of similarly N-terminally modified Abeta peptides, which constitute the most abundant species in AD and DS plaques. This observation suggests that N-truncated Abeta peptides are formed directly at beta-secretase level and not through a progressive proteolysis of full-length Abeta1-40/42. (iii) Among the differently cleaved CTFs, only the 22- and 12.5-kDa CTF polypeptides are tyrosine phosphorylated in both AD and control brain while the full-length APP and the CTFs migrating below the 12.5-kDa marker are not phosphorylated, suggesting that APP and CTFs may be involved in different pathways depending on their length and sequences.

The most striking fact was that ACE degraded A beta by cleaving A beta-(1-40) at the site Asp(7)-Ser(8). This was proven with reverse-phase HPLC, amino acid sequence analysis, and MALDI- TOF/MS. Compared with A beta-(1-40), aggregation and cytotoxic effects of the degradation products A beta-(1-7) and A beta-(8-40) peptides were reduced or virtually absent. These findings led to the hypothesis that ACE may affect susceptibility to AD by degrading A beta and preventing the accumulation of amyloid plaques in vivo.\", '']\n",

These conditional knockout mice were viable and grew normally, but they exhibited a pronounced deficiency in enrichment- induced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. This reduction in neurogenesis did not result in appreciable learning deficits, indicating that addition of new neurons is not required for memory formation. However, our postlearning enrichment experiments lead us to postulate that adult dentate neurogenesis may play a role in the periodic clearance of outdated hippocampal memory traces after cortical memory consolidation, thereby ensuring that the hippocampus is continuously available to process new memories. A chronic, abnormal clearance process in the hippocampus may conceivably lead to memory disorders in the mammalian brain.', '']\n",

To determine if the vaccinations had deleterious or beneficial functional consequences, we tested eight months of A beta vaccination in a different transgenic model for Alzheimer's disease in which mice develop learning deficits as amyloid accumulates. Here we show that vaccination with A beta protects transgenic mice from the learning and age-related memory deficits that normally occur in this mouse model for Alzheimer's disease. During testing for potential deleterious effects of the vaccine, all mice performed superbly on the radial-arm water- maze test of working memory. Later, at an age when untreated transgenic mice show memory deficits, the A beta-vaccinated transgenic mice showed cognitive performance superior to that of the control transgenic mice and, ultimately, performed as well as nontransgenic mice. The A beta- vaccinated mice also had a partial reduction in amyloid burden at the end of the study. This therapeutic approach may thus prevent and, possibly, treat Alzheimer's dementia.\", '']\n",

GP C1 was encephalitogenic in Le rats at doses as low as 15 ng. Rat C1 was encephalitogenic at doses of 1,500 ng or greater. LNC from rats challenged with 25 X 10(-4) micronmol of GP C1 and 250 X 10(-4) micronmol of rat C1 showed a proliferative response in vitro to both peptides, but in each instance the magnitude of the response was greater to the GP peptide. GP C1 also induced higher levels of circulating antibodies at 25 X 10(-4) micronmol, but the specificity of antibodies produced by the two peptides was the same. These results have been interpreted as indicating that the presence of serine at position 79 in GP C1 results in the stimulation of greater numbers of T cells involved in (a) the induction of EAE, (b) the in vitro proliferative response and (c) helper function in antibody production.',\n",

Hybridization signal for BDNF, but not NGF or NT-3, was decreased in samples of hippocampus from donors with AD.

The protocol provides neuropathologic definitions of such terms as \"definite Alzheimer\\'s disease\" (AD), \"probable AD,\" \"possible AD,\" and \"normal brain\" to indicate levels of diagnostic certainty, reduce subjective interpretation, and assure common language. To pretest the protocol, neuropathologists from 15 participating centers entered information on autopsy brains from 142 demented patients clinically diagnosed as probable AD and on eight nondemented patients. Eighty-four percent of the dementia cases fulfilled CERAD neuropathologic criteria for definite AD.

From frontal cortex and cortex, on the other hand, the tracer washed out as rapidly as it did from cerebellum, resulting in tissue-to-cerebellar ratios close to one in these regions at any time after injection.

There were the expected cortical metabolic deficits in AD and the serial studies showed a general increase in such deficits over time in 12 of the 13 cases. The regions showing the greatest declines with time in serial studies are the same as those showing the most severe deficiencies in cross-sectional studies. The young-onset case did not show a greater rate of metabolic decline than many of the older cases studied.

In addition, we evaluated CSF protein gradients by collecting CSF in serial fractions up to the 30th ml and assaying for total protein concentration. The mean rate of CSF production was significantly less in the elderly than in the young subjects. Mean CSF total protein concentrations were higher in the elderly than in the young, and significant rostrocaudal protein gradients with similar slopes were present in both groups. However, there was no correlation between CSF production and CSF total protein concentrations or protein gradient slopes.

Drugs known to interact with other receptor systems were weak competitors of the binding, while binding was potently inhibited by other D2 antagonists, such as spiperone and eticlopride.

       " '2905532|a|N1-([11C]-Methyl)-2-Br-LSD ([11C]-MBL) has been developed as a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent for serotonin 5-HT2 receptors. In vitro receptor binding assays with nonradioactive MBL show high-affinity binding to serotonin 5-HT2 receptors (Ki = 0.5 nM), a secondary interaction of 8-fold lower affinity with dopamine D2 receptors, and low-affinity interactions with alpha 1-adrenergic as well as serotonin 5-HT1 receptors. Intravenous injection of [11C]-MBL in a baboon led to selective labeling of cortical regions that was markedly blocked by prior administration of ketanserin, a selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonist. Clinical trials with [11C]-MBL have been conducted in seven normal human volunteers, and the regional distribution of radioactivity in the brain was distinctly serotonergic. Labeling was highest in frontal, temporal, and parietal cortex with lower levels observed in caudate and putamen. The tracer rapidly washed from the cerebellum and the low levels of activity in this brain region were used to define nonspecific binding. The maximum specificity was reached between 30 and 60 minutes postinjection when frontal cortex to cerebellum ratios ranged from 1.7 for a 52-year-old male to 2.7 for a 30-year-old male. In agreement with previous studies, a trend towards lower ratios (lower serotonin 5-HT2 receptor levels) was observed in older volunteers. These studies indicate that [11C]-MBL is a selective radioligand that can be used to monitor serotonin 5-HT2 receptor densities in vivo in most regions of the human brain.',\n",

       " '3187909|a|The potential importance of copper (Cu) in neurosecretion can be inferred from the demonstration that extracellular Cu modulates the secretory function of peptidergic neurons (in vitro studies) and from the presence of high Cu concentrations in nerve terminals and secretory vesicles, primarily within the soluble matrix of the latter. We have previously hypothesized that vesicular Cu is released from neurons undergoing exocytosis and that such extracellular Cu plays an important modulatory role in the central nervous system. To test this Cu release hypothesis, rat hypothalami were incubated under in vitro conditions for 1 or 2 hr with 20 nM radiolabeled Cu (67Cu), and then 67Cu release was stimulated by a depolarizing concentration (60 mM) of K+. K+ markedly (P less than 0.001) stimulated 67Cu release in a Ca2+-dependent manner (stimulated release was 95 fmol/10 min/mg protein after 1 hr 67Cu loading and 160 after 2 hr). These amounts of released 67Cu account for about 10% of the total 67Cu taken up by the tissue. These results indicate that part of the 67Cu taken up by hypothalamic explants is directed into an intracellular compartment from where it can be released by a Ca2+-dependent mechanism, thus providing strong support to our hypothesis that release of copper is operative in situ in the brain.',\n",

       " '4033771|a|Macrophages possess a receptor that binds low-density lipoproteins (LDL) containing lysine residues modified by acetylation (Ac LDL), acetoacetylation (AcAc LDL) or malondialdehyde treatment. This receptor (referred to as the Ac LDL receptor or scavenger receptor) internalizes the bound lipoprotein. As a consequence, massive amounts of cholesteryl esters accumulate so that macrophages in culture resemble foam cells found in atherosclerotic lesions. In an effort to identify an unmodified mammalian macromolecule that binds to the Ac LDL receptor, we investigated whether platelet secretory products affect the receptor-mediated endocytosis of chemically modified lipoproteins. Platelets are a potential source of such activity because they exist in close association with foam cells in developing atherosclerotic lesions. Our study demonstrates that human blood platelets secrete a product that inhibits the binding and uptake of AcAc LDL by mouse peritoneal macrophages and the subsequent accumulation of cholesteryl esters. This is the first indication that an endogenous macromolecule interacts with Ac LDL receptor on macrophages.',\n",

Azocasein, or AgNo3, can induce AEF in the spleen and liver. In the liver several subcellular organelles possess this activity. This is likely due to AEF's adherent properties. AEF is most effective when given by the intravenous route. After intravenous injection, AEF particulates localize to the perifollicular areas of the spleen and Kuppfer cells in the liver. The effects of AEF administration persist for at least 4 weeks. AEF can be solubilized in 4 M glycerol, is not the amyloid A protein, and is not likely to be the serum amyloid P component. The extract can be fractionated by Sepharose 4B column chromatography. The active component is of high molecular weight, and tentative identification by disc electrophoresis has been made.\",\n",

       " '7711278|a|The binding of a netropsin analogue to random sequence DNA, monitored by CD, is seen dependent on the concentration of neutral solutes. The binding free energy decreases linearly with solute osmolal concentration and the magnitude of the effect is insensitive to the chemical identity of the solute for betaine, sorbitol, and triethylene glycol. These solutes appear to modulate binding through their effect on water activity and changes in the hydration of the drug and DNA in the complex reaction, not through a direct interaction with the reactants or the product. The dependence of binding constant on solute concentration can be interpreted as an additional binding of some 50-60 extra solute excluding water molecules by the complex. A water sensitivity of drug binding is further seen from the dependence of binding constants on the type of anion in solution. Anions in the Hofmeister series strongly affect bulk water free energies and entropies. The differences in netropsin analogue binding to DNA with Cl-, F-, and ClO4- are consistent with the effect observed with neutral solutes. The ability to measure changes in water binding associated with a specific DNA interaction is a first step toward correlating changes in hydration with the strength and specificity of binding.',\n",

       " \"7715060|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine age-specific incidence rates of clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease. DESIGN: Cohort, followed a mean of 4.3 years. SETTING: East Boston, Mass. PARTICIPANTS: Of 2313 persons aged 65 years and older who were initially free of Alzheimer's disease, 1601 participated in the ascertainment of incident disease (80% of survivors), 409 declined participation, and 303 died before the end of the follow-up period. A stratified sample of 642 persons received detailed clinical evaluation. OUTCOME MEASURE: Diagnosis of new probable Alzheimer's disease through structured clinical evaluation including neurologic, neuropsychological, and psychiatric examination. Community incidence rates were computed by 5-year age groups, adjusted for gender, single year of age, length of follow-up interval, and sampling design. RESULTS: The estimated annual incidence of Alzheimer's disease in the population was 0.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3% to 0.9%) for persons aged 65 to 69 years, 1.0% (95% CI, 0.6% to 1.4%) for persons aged 70 to 74 years, 2.0% (95% CI, 1.3% to 2.7%) for persons aged 75 to 79 years, 3.3% (95% CI, 2.2% to 4.4%) for persons aged 80 to 84 years, and 8.4% (95% CI, 3.7% to 13.1%) for persons aged 85 years and older. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of Alzheimer's disease is substantial and is approximately 14 times higher among persons older than 85 years compared with those between 65 and 69 years of age.\",\n",

       " \"7890753|a|We analyzed the effect of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (bafA1) on the processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta APP). In kidney 293 cells stably transfected with the wild-type beta APP cDNA, bafA1 caused a stabilization of mature beta APP and its 10-kDa COOH-terminal fragment. Moreover, it caused a 2-3-fold increase in secretion of soluble APP and amyloid-beta protein (A beta). Interestingly, bafA1 treatment of cells transfected with a mutant beta APP isoform that occurs in a Swedish kindred with familial Alzheimer's disease resulted in a decrease of A beta production and no increase of soluble APP secretion. Identical results were obtained when the effect of bafA1 was analyzed on fibroblasts derived from affected versus unaffected members of the Swedish family. These data demonstrate a differential effect of bafA1 on the production of A beta derived from wild-type or Swedish mutant beta APP. Radiosequencing of A beta derived from bafA1-treated cells expressing wild-type beta APP revealed a marked increase of A beta peptides starting at amino acids phenylalanine 4 and valine -3 and a relative decrease of A beta molecules beginning at the typical NH2 terminus of aspartate 1. Cells transfected with the Swedish mutation and treated with bafA1 did not produce these alternative A beta peptides, so that bafA1 treatment resulted in a decrease of A beta starting at aspartate 1. Our data indicate that multiple proteases are able to cleave A beta at or near its NH2 terminus. Inhibition of the protease cleaving at aspartate 1 by bafA1 and perhaps other similar agents can result in an increase of alternatively cleaved peptides.\",\n",

We screened 100 sporadic and familial cases of early onset AD in order to determine the frequency of two of these mutations, APP 717 Val-->Ile and APP 713 Ala-->Val. The patients included fulfilled NINCDS-ADRDA criteria of probable AD and their age of onset was 60 or lower. Seventy-five cases were sporadic and 25 were familial with at least one first or second degree affected relative. None of our cases presented the mutations. Combined results allow to presume that the APP 717 Val-->Ile mutation accounts for less than 0.8% of all early onset AD, and 3.8 +/- 2.8% of familial cases. While the pathogenic effect of the APP 717 Val-->Ile mutation is established, this is not the case for the APP 713 Ala-->Val mutation.

       " '8144520|a|A macromolecule in human platelet secretory products was demonstrated previously to inhibit the binding and uptake of acetoacetylated (AcAc) low density lipoproteins (LDL) by scavenger receptors on mouse peritoneal macrophages. In the current study, this macromolecule was purified to apparent homogeneity by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography, Sephacryl S-300 chromatography, and sucrose gradient centrifugation. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a single band with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 120 kDa. Chemical analysis indicated that the macromolecule (designated platelet-derived macrophage-binding proteoglycan (PDMBP)) was a chondroitin 4-sulfate proteoglycan with an approximately 32-kDa core protein. A polyclonal antibody produced against this proteoglycan identified only PDMBP on Western blots of platelet secretory products and removed all ability of these products to inhibit the binding of AcAc LDL to macrophages. Treatment of purified PDMBP with protease or chondroitinase AC or ABC abolished the ability of the proteoglycan to inhibit the binding of AcAc LDL to macrophages. Binding studies using radiolabeled PDMBP demonstrated that the proteoglycan bound directly to the macrophage cell surface and was competitively inhibited by AcAc LDL, acetyl-LDL, fucoidin, and unlabeled PDMBP. PDMBP inhibited binding of 125I-labeled AcAc LDL to macrophages but had no effect on binding to endothelial cells. The finding that PDMBP binds to the scavenger receptor on macrophages suggests a mechanism for the inhibition of foam cell formation and suggests that the receptor could be involved in the plasma clearance of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans.',\n",

No satisfactory hypothesis has yet been proposed to explain the mechanism of beta-amyloid aggregation and toxicity. We present mass spectrometric and electron paramagnetic resonance spin trapping evidence that beta-amyloid, in aqueous solution, fragments and generates free radical peptides. beta-Amyloid fragments, at concentrations that previously have been shown to be neurotoxic to cultured neurons, can inactivate oxidation-sensitive glutamine synthetase and creatine kinase enzymes. Also, salicylate hydroxylation assays indicate that reactive oxygen species are generated by the beta-amyloid-(25-35) fragment during cell-free incubation. These results are formulated into a free radical-based unifying hypothesis for neurotoxicity of beta-amyloid and are discussed with reference to membrane molecular alterations in Alzheimer disease.',\n",

Studies of synthetic beta proteins (beta 1-39, beta 1-40, beta 1-42), and model peptides (beta 26-39, beta 26-40, beta 26-42, beta 26-43) demonstrate that amyloid formation is a nucleation-dependent phenomenon. Peptides ending at residues 39 or 40 were kinetically soluble for hours to days, while peptides ending at residues 42 or 43 aggregated immediately; all eventually reached similar thermodynamic solubility. The kinetically soluble variants could be seeded with the kinetically insoluble variants. The secondary structure of beta 26-39 fibrils was different from that of beta 26-42 fibrils, however, seeding beta 26-39 with beta 26-42 produces mixed fibrils with structure similar to beta 26-42.

Both deposits are known to include peptides that contain a common sequence. Both forms of amyloid were isolated and their peptide compositions were determined. The peptides were resolved by size-exclusion chromatography in 70% formic acid, and reverse-phase chromatography in 60% formic acid, 0-40% acetonitrile. Senile plaque amyloid cores contain about 25% protein, about 70% of which is composed of peptides containing the beta-amyloid sequence. Amino-terminal sequencing of the core amyloid peptides (CAPs) revealed extensive amino-terminal heterogeneity, with variable amounts of blocked amino termini. Matrix-assisted, laser-desorption-time-of-flight mass spectrometry of the CAP mixture revealed an array of peptides the molecular weights of which corresponded to peptides beginning with each of the first 11 amino acids of the beta-peptide sequence and ending with Ala-42 of that sequence. The carboxyl-terminal residues were identified by tandem mass spectrometry of chymotrypsin digests. CAP possessed a minor degree of carboxyl-terminal heterogeneity. Cerebrovascular amyloid peptides (CVAPs) possessed minor degrees of both amino- and carboxyl-terminal heterogeneity. The major CVAP commenced at Asp-1 and ended at Val-40. Minor components of CAP possessed masses of 8000-9000 Da and the same amino-terminal residues as the major components of CAP. They may be precursors to the smaller CAPs. The differences in amino termini and carboxyl termini of CAPs and CVAPs suggest that the two types of amyloid form by different pathways, on which they encounter different proteases.\",\n",

       " \"8450993|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a general population sample. BACKGROUND: Utilizing subjects in the Framingham Study cohort determined to be free of dementia in 1976 to 1978, or on biennial examination 17 in 1982, all new cases of dementia arising in this cohort over a maximum of 10 years of follow-up were ascertained. METHODS: On biennial examination 14/15, a screening neuropsychologic examination was administered to 2,117 subjects, and cases of probable prevalent dementia were identified. Beginning on examination 17 and on all successive biennial examinations, a Mini-Mental State Examination was administered. Subjects previously free of dementia and falling below age-education levels were evaluated by a neurologist and neuropsychologist to determine if dementia was present and to ascertain the dementia type using standard criteria. RESULTS: Five-year incidence of dementia increased with age, doubling in successive 5-year age groups. Dementia incidence rose from 7.0 per 1,000 at ages 65 to 69 to 118.0 per 1,000 at ages 85 to 89 for men and women combined. Incidence of probable AD also doubled with successive quinquennia from 3.5 at ages 65 to 69 to 72.8 per 1,000 at ages 85 to 89 years. Incidence of dementia and of probable AD did not level off with age and was not different in men and women. CONCLUSIONS: In a general population sample, we determined incidence of dementia and of probable AD and will use these incident cases for study of precursors and natural history in this elderly cohort, which has been under close surveillance for over 40 years.\",\n",

       " \"8588942|a|The Alzheimer's disease beta A4 amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been shown to be involved in a diverse set of biological activities including regulation of cell growth, neurite outgrowth and adhesiveness. The APP and amyloid protein precursor-like proteins (APLP1 and APLP2) belong to a superfamily of proteins that are probably functionally related. In order to characterize the cell adhesion properties of APP the brain specific isoform APP695 was purified and used to assess the binding to heparin, a structural and functional analogue of the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate. We show that APP binds in a time dependent and saturable manner to heparin. The salt concentration of 620 mM at which APP elutes from heparin Sepharose is greater than physiological. The apparent equilibrium constant for dissociation was determined to be 300 pM for APP binding to heparin Sepharose. A high affinity heparin binding site was identified within a region conserved in rodent and human APP, APLP1 and APLP2. This binding site was located between residues 316-337 of APP695 which is within the carbohydrate domain of APP. We also demonstrate an interaction between this heparin binding site and the zinc(II) binding site which is conserved in all members of the APP superfamily. We show by using an automated surface plasmon resonance biosensor (BIAcore, Pharmacia) that the affinity for heparin is increased two- to four-fold in the presence of micromolar zinc(II). The identification of zinc-enhanced binding of APP to heparan sulfate side chains of proteoglycans offers a molecular link between zinc(II), as a putative environmental toxin for Alzheimer's disease, and aggregation of amyloid beta A4 protein.\",\n",

       " \"8592548|a|BACKGROUND: Variants of the apolipoprotein E allele appear to account for most cases of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, and persons with two copies of the epsilon 4 allele appear to have an especially high risk of dementia. Positron-emission tomography (PET) has identified specific regions of the brain in which the rate of glucose metabolism declines progressively in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease. We used PET to investigate whether these same regions of the brain are affected in subjects homozygous for the epsilon 4 allele before the onset of cognitive impairment. METHODS: Apolipoprotein E genotypes were established in 235 volunteers 50 to 65 years of age who reported a family history of probable Alzheimer's disease. Neurologic and psychiatric evaluations, a battery of neuropsychological tests, magnetic resonance imaging, and PET were performed in 11 epsilon 4 homozygotes and 22 controls without the epsilon 4 allele who were matched for sex, age, and level of education. An automated method was used to generate an aggregate surface-projection map that compared regional rates of glucose metabolism in the two groups. RESULTS: The epsilon 4 homozygotes were cognitively normal. They had significantly reduced rates of glucose metabolism in the same posterior cingulate, parietal, temporal, and prefrontal regions as in previously studied patients with probable Alzheimer's disease. They also had reduced rates of glucose metabolism in additional prefrontal regions, which may be preferentially affected during normal aging. CONCLUSIONS: In late middle age, cognitively normal subjects who are homozygous for the epsilon 4 allele for apolipoprotein E have reduced glucose metabolism in the same regions of the brain as in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease. These findings provide preclinical evidence that the presence of the epsilon 4 allele is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. PET may offer a relatively rapid way of testing future treatments to prevent Alzheimer's disease.\",\n",

Here we describe the human protein Pin1, a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) that interacts with NIMA. PPIases are important in protein folding, assembly and/or transport, but none has so far been shown to be required for cell viability. Pin1 is nuclear PPIase containing a WW protein interaction domain, and is structurally and functionally related to Ess1/Ptf1, an essential protein in budding yeast. PPIase activity is necessary for Ess1/Pin1 function in yeast. Depletion of Pin1/Ess1 from yeast or HeLa cells induces mitotic arrest, whereas HeLa cells overexpressing Pin1 arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Pin1 is thus an essential PPIase that regulates mitosis presumably by interacting with NIMA and attenuating its mitosis-promoting activity.',\n",

       " '8873896|a|Transcriptional changes in corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) gene expression were studied by in situ hybridization histochemistry using cRNA probes directed against intronic sequences. Acute ether stress resulted in a rapid induction of CRF and a delayed activation of vasopressin heteronuclear (hn)RNA in the parvocellular neurosecretory neurons within the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. To explore possible molecular mechanisms regulating stress-related neuropeptide expression in vivo, the time-courses of stress-induced activation of different transcription factor classes were compared to that of changes in neuropeptide transcription. The peak of CRF transcription was parallel to that of cAMP response-element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation but preceded the induction of c-fos and NGFI-B mRNAs and Fos protein. In contrast, AVP expression occurred in step with immediate-early gene (IEG) responses, suggesting involvement of different mechanisms underlying stress-induced neuropeptide responses. The interference of glucocorticoid hormones with stress-induced neuropeptide and transcription-factor responses has also been revealed in rats acutely or chronically pretreated with glucocorticoids. Acute dexamethasone injection did not prevent neuropeptide and transcription factor responses to either inhalation, whereas chronic corticosterone administration completely blocked IEG and neuropeptide induction in the stress-related neurosecretory neurons.',\n",

Peptide T is an octapeptide under investigation for treatment of ADC patients. Values of rCMRglc were converted to Z scores using the mean and standard deviation of values of rCMRglc in three HIV-seronegative matched controls, each of which was studied twice, at the beginning and end of a 12-wk interval. Thirty-five of 60 regions assayed showed Z scores with absolute values > or = 3 (considered abnormal) in the baseline study. Regions with high absolute values of Z scores were located in subcortical areas and in the limbic system, and to a lesser degree in the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes. Thirty-four of these 35 regions showed remission (decrease in the absolute values of Z scores) after treatment. Only one region showed no improvement in the second study. Three regions with absolute values of Z scores < 3 in the baseline study manifested Z scores with magnitudes > or = 3 in the second study.

In vitro binding studies were conducted in order to determine the affinity of the (+)- and (-)-stereoisomers of FBT for the VAcChT as well as sigma (sigma 1 and sigma 2) receptors. (+)-FBT was found to have a high affinity (Ki = 0.22 nM) for the VAcChT and lower affinities for sigma 1 (21.6 nM) and sigma 2 (35.9 nM) receptors, whereas (-)-FBT had similar affinities for the VAcChT and sigma 1 receptors (approximately 20 nM) and a lower affinity for sigma 2 (110 nM) receptors. PET imaging studies were conducted in rhesus monkeys (n = 3) with [18F](+)-FBT. [18F](+)-FBT was found to have a high accumulation and slow rate of washout from the basal ganglia, which is consistent with the labeling of cholinergic interneurons in this brain region. [18F](+)-FBT also displayed reversible binding kinetics during the 3 h time course of PET and produced radiolabeled metabolites that did not cross the blood-brain barrier.

       " '9100663|a|Senile plaques (SP) are complicated lesions composed of diverse amyloid peptides and associated molecules, degenerating neuronal processes,a nd reactive glia. Evidence suggests that diffuse, neurocentric amyloid deposits evolve over time with formation of discrete niduses that eventually become neuritic SP. The evidence for differential amyloid precursor protein metabolism that may favor deposition of A beta 17-42 in this early, possibly aging-related lesion is discussed. This latter molecule, also known as P3, may represent a benign form of amyloid, since it lacks domains associated with activation and recruitment of glia to SP. Subsequent to deposition of A beta 1-42 and then growth of the amyloid with precipitation of soluble A beta 1-40, in an Alzheimer disease-specific process, SP increasingly become associated with activated microglia and reactive astrocytes. In response to interaction with amyloid peptides and possibly glycated proteins, microglia and astrocytes produce a number of molecules that may be locally toxic to neuronal processes in the vicinity of SP, including cytokines, reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates, and proteases. They also produce factors that lead to their reciprocal activation and growth, which potentiate a local inflammatory cascade. Paired helical filament- (PHF) type neurites appear to be associated with SP only in so far as neurofibrillary degeneration has progressed to affect neurons in those regions where the plaque forms. Thus, PHF-type neurites are readily apparent in SP in the amygdala at an early stage, while they are late in primary cortices and never detected in cerebellar plaques; where only dystrophic neurites are detected. If the various stages of SP pathogenesis can be further clarified, it may be possible to develop rational approaches to therapy directed at site-, cell type-, and stage-specific interventions. Although controlling the local inflammatory microenvironment of SP may hold promise for slowing lesion pathogenesis, it still remains a fundamental challenge to determine the mechanism of neurodegeneration that results in widespread neurofibrillary degeneration and eventual synaptic and neuronal loss, which is considered to be the proximate cause of the clinical dementia syndrome.',\n",

Delayed neurotoxicity was also induced by ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, and nitric oxide (NO) donors such as S-nitrosocysteine (SNOC) and 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1). Incubating cultures with BDNF for 10 min to 24 h protected cortical neurons against glutamate neurotoxicity. The protective effects of BDNF against glutamate cytotoxicity were dependent on both its concentrations and incubation time. BDNF also prevented the ionomycin-, SNOC-, and SIN-1 induced cytotoxicity. These results indicate that BDNF protects cultured cortical neurons from NMDA receptor-mediated glutamate neurotoxicity by reducing cytotoxic action of NO.',\n",

       " '9215598|a|Tomographic imaging of central nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) via single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has been hampered by the lack of a radioligand with suitable in vivo binding characteristics. Therefore, a novel analog of epibatidine, (+/-)-exo-2-(2-iodo-5-pyridyl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (IPH), labeled with [(125)I] or [(123)I] was evaluated as an in vivo marker of central nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). [(125)I]IPH showed substantial brain penetration (4.2% of the injected dose at 30 min) and a cerebral biodistribution in mice consistent with the in vivo labeling of nAChRs (% injected dose/gram of thalamus, superior colliculi >> cerebellum). [(125)I]IPH binding sites were shown to be saturable with unlabeled IPH (ED50 approximately 1 microg/kg). The uptake of [(125)I]IPH was blocked significantly by the nicotinic agonists, cytisine, lobeline, and (-)-nicotine, but not by the noncompetitive nAChR antagonist, mecamylamine. Antagonists of muscarinic (scopolamine), serotonin (ketanserin), and opioid (naloxone) receptors had no significant effect on [(125)I]IPH binding. A preliminary SPECT imaging study with [(123)I]IPH in a baboon showed [(123)I]IPH to localize in nAChR-rich areas of brain (thalamus > frontal cortex > cerebellum). [(123)I]IPH binding in baboon brain was also displaced (35-45% displacement) by a challenge dose of cytisine showing that a well-characterized nicotinic agonist effectively competes for [(123)I]IPH binding sites. [(123)I]IPH seems well suited for imaging studies of nAChRs and, to our knowledge, is the first SPECT agent that has allowed for the visualization of nAChRs in primate brain.',\n",

The VER's usefulness in the individual patient remains undetermined. With today's techniques, too many patients are misclassified. False negatives may result if Alzheimer's patients with visual symptoms are a distinct subgroup. Those with a normal flash VER may have cortical dysfunction outside the visual association areas. This would most likely be in the earliest stages of the disease before the atrophy becomes widespread. It may be that a VER test would only be valid in established disease. Future research should use adequate numbers of patients who are in a single category of mild, moderate or severe, so that the applicability of a VER test in the early stages of the disease can be determined. Strict diagnostic criteria such as the NINCDS-ADRDA guidelines should be used. Patients should be drug free, or at least not taking medications with anticholinergic properties. Flash VER should be obtained using a strobe light with eyes closed, and the pattern VER using a black and white television with a large pattern and high contrast.\",\n",

Both compounds also inhibited the excitotoxic death of cultured cortical neurons induced by exposure to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), or oxygen-glucose deprivation, but the C3 regioisomer was more effective than the D3 regioisomer, possibly reflecting its polar nature and attendant greater ability to enter lipid membranes. At 100 microM, the C3 derivative fully blocked even rapidly triggered, NMDA receptor-mediated toxicity, a form of toxicity with limited sensitivity to all other classes of free radical scavengers we have tested. The C3 derivative also reduced apoptotic neuronal death induced by either serum deprivation or exposure to Abeta1-42 protein. Furthermore, continuous infusion of the C3 derivative in a transgenic mouse carrying the human mutant (G93A) superoxide dismutase gene responsible for a form of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, delayed both death and functional deterioration.

       " \"9330961|a|Alzheimer's disease is a relentlessly progressing dementing disorder. Major pathological hallmarks include extracellular deposits of amyloid protein and intraneuronal neurofibrillary changes. No remissions occur in the course of the disease. Initial amyloid deposits develop in poorly myelinated areas of the basal neocortex. From there, they spread into adjoining areas and the hippocampus. Deposits eventually infiltrate all cortical areas, including densely myelinated primary fields of the neocortex (stages A-C). Intraneuronal lesions develop initially in the transentorhinal region, then spread in a predictable manner across other areas (stages I-VI). At stages I-II, neurofibrillary changes develop preferentially in the absence of amyloid deposits. A proportion of cases shows early development of amyloid deposits and/or intraneuronal changes. Advanced age is thus not a prerequisite for the evolution of the lesions. Alzheimer's disease is an age-related, not an age-dependent disease. The degree of brain destruction at stages III-IV frequently leads to the appearance of initial clinical symptoms. The stages V-VI representing fully developed Alzheimer's disease are increasingly prevalent with increasing age. The arithmetic means of the stages of both the amyloid-depositing and the neurofibrillary pathology increase with age. Age is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.\",\n",

The diffusion of the neurofibrillary tangles in the paralimbic, limbic and isocortical areas (described by braak and Braak stages or by the number of areas containing tangles) and the density of isocortical senile plaques (A beta focal deposits) as assessed by the CERAD protocol are both correlated with the intellectual status but give complementary information.

       " \"9334350|a|Mutations in the genes for presenilin 1 and 2 (PS-1 and PS-2) have been linked to development of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). As neither the normal function of either presenilin is known nor why mutations cause disease, we examined the properties of wild-type, truncated, and mutant PS-2 upon expression in HeLa cells. Although HeLa cells are strongly predisposed to continued mitosis, expression of PS-2 induced programmed cell death (apoptosis). Direct evidence for apoptosis was obtained by double staining for terminal deoxynucleotide transferase nick end labeling (TUNEL) and PS-2 expression and by following green fluorescent protein-tagged PS-2 over time. Deletion analysis indicates that as little as 166 NH2-terminal residues of PS-2 are sufficient for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization and apoptosis. Moreover, the AD- associated PS-2 missense mutation (N141I) more efficiently induced cell death compared to wild-type PS-2 despite lower mutant protein accumulation. Expression of the presenilins in several other cell lines and transgenic mice has been accompanied by rapid protein cleavage without the induction of cell death. In contrast, PS-2 expressed in HeLa cells was not cleaved, and cell death occurred. We hypothesize that full-length but not cleaved PS-2 may be important in the regulation or induction of apoptosis.\",\n",

       " '9374341|t|Longer occupancy of opioid receptors by nalmefene compared to naloxone as measured in vivo by a dual-detector system.',\n",
       " '9374341|a|UNLABELLED: Surgical procedures usually involve the administration of narcotic drugs as anesthetics or adjuvants. To reverse the effects of anesthesia, opioid antagonists such as naloxone are commonly used. Due to its short lasting effects, patients receiving naloxone must be monitored carefully. Nalmefene, a pure opiate antagonist with a longer duration of action than naloxone, has shown promise in the reversal of opioid anesthesia. METHODS: A simple dual-detector positron radiation detector system and [11C]carfentanil were used to compare the duration of blockade of cerebral mu opioid receptors by naloxone and nalmefene in eight normal volunteers. Carbon-11-carfentanil brain kinetics were monitored for 5 min and 2, 4, 8 and 24 hr after the administration of either nalmefene (1 mg or 1 microg/kg) or naloxone (2 mg or 2 microg/kg). Blood samples were obtained at the same times for plasma determinations. RESULTS: Clearance half-times from opioid receptors were 28.7 +/- 5.9 hr for 1 mg of nalmefene and 2.0 +/- 1.6 hr for 2 mg of naloxone. Brain clearance times were about 21.1 and 3.4 times slower than plasma clearance times for nalmefene and naloxone, respectively. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the prolonged effects of nalmefene are related to the slow dissociation of nalmefene from opioid receptors, which are not reflected in the plasma curve. This longer blockade of opioid receptors by nalmefene represents an advantage in the clinical management of postsurgical reversal of narcotic anesthesia and opioid side effects as well as the reversal of opioid overdose.',\n",

       " '9374343|a|UNLABELLED: Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) have been implicated in a variety of central processes, such as learning and memory and analgesia. These receptors also mediate the reinforcing properties of nicotine in tobacco products and are increased in postmortem samples of brains of smokers. On the other hand, brains of individuals who have died from dementia of the Alzheimer type show abnormally low densities of nAChRs. In this study, the distribution and kinetics of [(+/-)-exo-2-(2-[18F] fluoro-5-pyridyl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (18F-FPH), a high-affinity nAChR agonist, was evaluated in a baboon using PET. METHODS: After intravenous injection of 5 mCi [185 MBq] 18F-FPH into a 25-kg anesthetized baboon, sequential quantitative tomographic data were acquired over a period of 150 min. Regions of interest were placed and time-activity curves were generated. Brain kinetics of the radiotracer were calculated, and the in vivo regional binding in the baboon brain was compared with the known in vitro regional distribution of nAChRs in the rat and human brain. RESULTS: Brain activity reached a plateau within 60 min after injection of the tracer, and the binding was reversible. Elimination of 18F-FPH was relatively rapid from the cerebellum (clearance t[1/2] = 3 hr), intermediate from the hypothalamus/midbrain (t[1/2] = 7 hr) and slow from the thalamus (t[1/2] = 16 hr). Radioactivity due to 18F-FPH at 130 min postinjection was highest in the thalamus and hypothalamus/midbrain, intermediate in the neocortex and hippocampus and lowest in the cerebellum. Subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg cytisine 45 min after injection of the radiotracer reduced brain activity at 130 min by 67%, 64%, 56% and 52% of control values in the thalamus, hypothalamus/midbrain, hippocampus and cerebellum, respectively. The regional binding of 18F-FPH at 130 min was highly correlated with the known densities of nAChR measured in vitro in human (r = 0.81) and rat brain (r = 0.90). CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the feasibility of imaging nAChRs in vivo. Fluorine-18-FPH appears to be a suitable tracer to study nAChRs in the human brain.',\n",

Consistent with this hypothesis, a reduction in BDNF mRNA expression has been observed in human post-mortem Alzheimer's disease hippocampi. To further investigate this observation, we examined whether the alteration in BDNF expression also occurred at the protein level in human post-mortem Alzheimer's disease hippocampi and temporal cortices using immunohistochemical techniques. We observed a reduction in the intensity and number of BDNF-immunoreactive cell bodies within both the Alzheimer's disease hippocampus and temporal cortex when compared to normal tissue. These results support and extend previous findings that BDNF mRNA is reduced in the human Alzheimer's disease hippocampus and temporal cortex, and suggest that a loss of BDNF may contribute to the progressive atrophy of neurons in Alzheimer's disease.\",\n",

       " '9412518|a|The present study sought to determine whether doses of methamphetamine in the range of those used recreationally by humans produce brain dopamine (DA) neurotoxicity in baboons and to ascertain whether positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the DA transporter (DAT) ligand [11C]WIN-35,428 ([11C]2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl)-tropane) could be used to detect methamphetamine-induced DAT loss in living primates. Baboons were treated with saline (n = 3) or one of three doses of methamphetamine [0.5 mg/kg (n = 2); 1 mg/kg (n = 2); and 2 mg/kg (n = 3)], each of which was given intramuscularly four times at 2 hr intervals. PET studies were performed before and 2-3 weeks after methamphetamine treatment. After the final PET studies, animals were killed for direct neurochemical determination of brain DA axonal markers. PET-derived binding potential values, used to index striatal DAT density, were significantly decreased after methamphetamine, with larger decreases occurring after higher methamphetamine doses. Reductions in striatal DAT documented by PET were associated with decreases in DA, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and specific [3H]WIN-35,428 and [3H]DTBZ binding determined in vitro. Decreases in DAT detected with PET were highly correlated with decreases in specific [3H]WIN-35,428 binding determined in vitro in the caudate of the same animal (r = 0.77; p = 0.042). These results indicate that methamphetamine, at doses used by some humans, produces long-term reductions in brain DA axonal markers in baboons, and that it is possible to detect methamphetamine-induced DAT loss in living nonhuman primates by means of PET.',\n",

       " '9499405|a|Phosphorylation of mitotic proteins on the Ser/Thr-Pro motifs has been shown to play an important role in regulating mitotic progression. Pin1 is a novel essential peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) that inhibits entry into mitosis and is also required for proper progression through mitosis, but its substrate(s) and function(s) remain to be determined. Here we report that in both human cells and Xenopus extracts, Pin1 interacts directly with a subset of mitotic phosphoproteins on phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs in a phosphorylation-dependent and mitosis-specific manner. Many of these Pin1-binding proteins are also recognized by the monoclonal antibody MPM-2, and they include the important mitotic regulators Cdc25, Myt1, Wee1, Plk1, and Cdc27. The importance of this Pin1 interaction was tested by constructing two Pin1 active site point mutants that fail to bind a phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motif in mitotic phosphoproteins. Wild-type, but not mutant, Pin1 inhibits both mitotic division in Xenopus embryos and entry into mitosis in Xenopus extracts. We have examined the interaction between Pin1 and Cdc25 in detail. Pin1 not only binds the mitotic form of Cdc25 on the phosphorylation sites important for its activity in vitro and in vivo, but it also inhibits its activity, offering one explanation for the ability of Pin1 to inhibit mitotic entry. In a separate paper, we have shown that Pin1 is a phosphorylation-dependent PPIase that can recognize specifically the phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro bonds present in mitotic phosphoproteins. Thus, Pin1 likely acts as a general regulator of mitotic proteins that have been phosphorylated by Cdc2 and other mitotic kinases.',\n",

       " '9551834|a|Cells in the superficial layers of the superior colliculus of the cat have mainly binocular receptive fields. The aim of the present experiment was to investigate the sensitivity of these cells to horizontal spatial disparity. Unit recordings were carried out in the superficial layers of the superior colliculus of paralyzed and anesthetized cats. Centrally located receptive fields were mapped, separated using prisms, and then stimulated simultaneously using two luminous bars optimally adjusted to the size of the excitatory region of the receptive fields. Only binocular cells were tested, and 65% of these units were found to be sensitive to spatial disparities. Some cells (20%) were clearly insensitive to spatial disparity and the remaining 15% showed complex, unclassifiable interactions. The sensitive cells could be divided into four classes based on their disparity-sensitivity profiles: 38% showed excitatory interactions, whereas 9% showed inhibitory interactions. Moreover, 11% and 7% of the cells responded, respectively, to crossed or uncrossed disparities, and were classified as near cells and far cells. Whereas the general shapes of the sensitivity profiles were similar to those of cells in areas 17-18, selectivity in the superior colliculus was significantly coarser. The superficial layers of the superior colliculus project topographically to the deep layers of the superior colliculus, which are known to contain circuits involved in the control of ocular movements. The results thus suggest that disparity-sensitive cells of the superior colliculus could feed information to these oculomotor neurons, allowing for the localization and fixation of objects on the appropriate plane of vision.',\n",

       "  \"28174113|a|To elucidate whether a permanent reduction of the GluN2B subunit affects the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we cross-bred mice heterozygous for GluN2B receptors in the forebrain (hetGluN2B) with a mouse model for AD carrying a mutated amyloid precursor protein with the Swedish and Arctic mutation (mAPP) resulting in a hetGluN2B/mAPP transgenic. By means of voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) in the di-synaptic hippocampal pathway and the recording of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs), hippocampal slices of all genotypes (WT, hetGluN2B, mAPP and hetGluN2B/mAPP, age 9-18 months) were tested for spatiotemporal activity propagation and long-term potentiation (LTP) induction. CA1-LTP induced by high frequency stimulation (HFS; 100 Hz/1s) was not different in all genotypes. Abeta1-42 (50 nM)-application reduced potentiation of fEPSP in WT and hetGluN2B/mAPP mice, LTP in mAPP and hetGluN2B mice was not affected. For VSDI a fast depolarization signal was evoked in the granule cell layer and propagation was analysed in hippocampal CA3 and CA1 region before and after theta stimulation (100pulses/5 Hz). LTP was not significantly different between all genotypes. In mAPP mice theta-stim produced an epileptiform activity reflected in a pronounced prolongation of the FDS compared to the other genotypes. In slices of hetGluN2B/mAPP and GluN2B mice, however, these parameters were similar to WT mice indicating a reversal effect of the attenuated GluN2B expression. The induction of a hetGluN2B mutation in the mAPP reversed some pathophysiological changes on hippocampal LTP and provide further evidence for the involvement of the glutamatergic system in AD and emphasize the GluN2B subunit as a potential target for AD treatment.\",\n",

       "  \"28279845|a|A series of novel ferulic acid-O-alkylamines derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as multitarget-directed ligands against Alzheimer's disease. In vitro studies displayed that all the synthesized target compounds showed impressive inhibitory activity against butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), significant inhibition/disaggregation of self-induced beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation and acted as potential antioxidants. Particularly, compound 7f, one of the most potent BuChE inhibitor (IC50 value of 0.021 muM for equine serum BuChE, 8.63 muM for ratBuChE and 0.07 muM for human serum BuChE), was found to be a good acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor (IC50 = 2.13 muM for electric eel AChE, 1.8 muM for ratAChE and 3.82 muM for human erythrocytes AChE), and the result of molecular docking provided an explanation for its selective BuChE inhibitory activity. Compound 7f also had noteworthy inhibitory effects on self-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation (50.8 +- 0.82%) and was found to disaggregate self-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation (38.7 +- 0.65%), which was further elucidated by the transmission electron microscopy. Meanwhile, compound 7f showed the modest antioxidant activity (0.55 eq of Trolox), good protective effect against H2O2-induced PC12 cell injury, with low toxicity. Moreover, compound 7f could cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vitro. Significantly, compound 7f did not exhibit any acute toxicity in mice at doses up to 1000 mg/kg, and the step-down passive avoidance test showed this compound significantly reversed scopolamine-induced memory deficit in mice. Taken together, the results indicated that compound 7f is a very promising multifunctional agent in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, particularly the advanced stages of AD.\",\n",

This increased life expectancy is accompanied by a higher prevalence of HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders. Rising too is the incidence in these patients of pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease such as increased deposition of amyloid beta protein (Abeta). Although neurons are major sources of Abeta in the brain, astrocytes are the most numerous glial cells, therefore, even a small level of astrocytic Abeta metabolism could make a significant contribution to brain pathology. Neprilysin (NEP) is a decisive/crucial regulator of Abeta levels. We evaluated the effects of HIV-1 on Abeta deposition and the expression and activity of NEP in primary human astrocytes. Specifically, no differences in intracellular amyloid deposits were found between infected and control cells. However, primary cultures of infected astrocytes showed more extracellular Abeta levels compared to controls. This was accompanied by reduced expression of NEP and to a significant decrease in its activity. These results indicate that the presence of HIV-1 in the brain could contribute to the increase in the total burden of cerebral Abeta.\",\n",

       "  \"29572646|a|The function of the beta-A4 amyloid protein precursor (APP) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. APP has a number of putative roles in neuronal differentiation, survival, synaptogenesis and cell adhesion. In this study, we examined the development of axons, dendrites and synapses in cultures of hippocampus neutrons derived from APP knockout (KO) mice. We report that loss of APP function reduces the branching of cultured hippocampal neurons, resulting in reduced synapse formation. Using a compartmentalised culture approach, we found reduced axonal outgrowth in cultured hippocampal neurons and we also identified abnormal growth characteristics of isolated hippocampal neuron axons. Although APP has previously been suggested to play an important role in promoting cell adhesion, we surprisingly found that APPKO hippocampal neurons adhered more strongly to a poly-L-lysine substrate and their neurites displayed an increased density of focal adhesion puncta. The findings suggest that the function of APP has an important role in both dendritic and axonal growth and that endogenous APP may regulate substrate adhesion of hippocampal neurons. The results may explain neuronal and synaptic morphological abnormalities in APPKO mice and the presence of abnormal APP expression in dystrophic neurites around amyloid deposits in AD.\",\n",

       "  \"29738880|a|alpha-synuclein and Tau are proteins prone to pathological misfolding and aggregation that are normally found in the presynaptic and axonal compartments of neurons. Misfolding initiates a homo-oligomerization and aggregation cascade culminating in cerebral accumulation of aggregated alpha-synuclein and Tau in insoluble protein inclusions in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Traditionally, alpha-synuclein-containing Lewy bodies have been associated with Parkinson's disease and Tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles with Alzheimer's disease and various frontotemporal dementia syndromes. However, there is significant overlap and co-occurrence of alpha-synuclein and Tau pathologies in a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases. Importantly, alpha-synuclein and Tau can interact in cells, and their pathological conformations are capable of templating further misfolding and aggregation of each other. They also share a number of protein interactors indicating that network perturbations may contribute to chronic proteotoxic stress and neuronal dysfunction in synucleinopathies and tauopathies, some of which share similarities in both neuropathological and clinical manifestations. In this review, we focus on the protein interactions of these two pathologically important proteins and consider a network biology perspective towards neurodegenerative diseases.\",\n",

       "  \"29869063|a|PURPOSE: To identify the most vulnerable network among typical and three variants of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to link amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition and downstream network dysfunction. PROCEDURES: In this study, 38 typical AD, 11 frontal variants, 8 logopenic variants, 6 posterior variants, and 20 normal controls were enrolled. 2-(4'-[11C] Methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole ([11C]PIB) and 2-deoxy-2-[18]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging were performed. Voxel-wise statistical analysis was used for [18F]FDG analysis, whereas two-sample t test was performed between each AD group and control group. Moreover, the goodness of fit (GOF) of t-maps with brain functional network templates was assessed, and the most vulnerable network in each phenotypic of AD was chosen as volume of interests (VOIs). [11C]PIB binding potential (BPND) of VOIs were generated by using PMOD software. In addition, statistical analysis of BPND among four types of AD in each specific network was calculated by SPSS software. RESULTS: The hypometabolism patterns indicated that in typical and frontal variants of AD, the most vulnerable network was the left executive control network (GOF score = 4.3, 5.0). For the logopenic variant, the highest GOF score (1.9) belonged to the auditory network. For the posterior variant, the higher visual network was the most vulnerable (GOF score = 6.0). The [11C]PIB BPND showed that there were no significant differences (p > 0.05) among AD groups within the specific networks. CONCLUSION: The phenotypic diversity of AD correlates with specific functional network failure; however, Abeta plaques do not associate with specific network vulnerability.\",\n",

       "  \"29934546|a|Extracellular aggregates of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, which are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD), act as an essential trigger for glial cell activation and the release of ATP, leading to the stimulation of purinergic receptors, especially the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R). However, the involvement of P2X7R in the development of AD is still ill-defined regarding the dual properties of this receptor. Particularly, P2X7R activates the NLRP3 inflammasome leading to the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1beta; however, P2X7R also induces cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein generating Abeta peptides or the neuroprotective fragment sAPPalpha. We thus explored in detail the functions of P2X7R in AD transgenic mice. Here, we show that P2X7R deficiency reduced Abeta lesions, rescued cognitive deficits and improved synaptic plasticity in AD mice. However, the lack of P2X7R did not significantly affect the release of IL-1beta or the levels of non-amyloidogenic fragment, sAPPalpha, in AD mice. Instead, our results show that P2X7R plays a critical role in Abeta peptide-mediated release of chemokines, particularly CCL3, which is associated with pathogenic CD8+ T cell recruitment. In conclusion, our study highlights a novel detrimental function of P2X7R in chemokine release and supports the notion that P2X7R may be a promising therapeutic target for AD.\",\n",

       "  \"29995422|a|Bexarotene, an agonist of retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha), has been shown to increase the expression of apoE, ABCA1, and ABCG1 by activating RXR/LXR and RXR/PPAR heterodimers, resulting in amyloid beta (Abeta)-protein clearance in the brain of an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model and reversal of mouse cognitive deficits. Nitrostyrene derivative Z-10 is the first identified nitro-ligand of RXRalpha. We hypothesized that Z-10 and its derivatives have the similar effect as bexarotene. A series of Z-10 derivatives were synthesized by introducing methoxyl, hydroxyl, and methoxy groups in 2- or 4-position of naphthalene ring, respectively. Our reporter gene assays showed that the derivatives with substituted groups of methyl and methoxyl in position 2 were more potent to activate Gal4-DBD/RXRalpha-LBD and RXRalpha homodimer as well as RXRalpha heterodimers than the corresponding 4-substituted derivatives. The derivatives with hydroxyl substitution in either 2- or 4-position failed to activate RXRalpha. Consistently, the derivatives with stronger potency of RXRalpha activation had higher RXRalpha binding affinity. Z-10 and its 2-ethyoxyl substituted derivative Z-36 reduced Abeta plaques in both hippocampus and cortex of AD mouse model significantly, of which Z-36 had stronger efficacy. This may due to the stronger ability of Z-36 than Z-10 in activating RXR/LXR and RXR/PPAR heterodimers and inducing ABCA1 and ABCG1 expressions. Thus, the 2- rather than 4-position was the better site for Z-10 modification as to RXRalpha transactivation, and Z-36 is an optimized derivative of Z-10 as to reducing Abeta plaques in AD mouse model.\",\n",

       "  \"30028551|a|Histone deacetylases (HDACs) catalyze acetyl group removal from histone proteins, leading to altered chromatin structure and gene expression. HDAC2 is highly expressed in adult brain, and HDAC2 levels are elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. We previously reported that neuron-specific splice isoforms of Endophilin-B1 (Endo-B1) promote neuronal survival, but are reduced in human AD brain and mouse models of AD and stroke. Here, we demonstrate that HDAC2 suppresses Endo-B1 expression. HDAC2 knockdown or knockout enhances expression of Endo-B1. Conversely, HDAC2 overexpression decreases Endo-B1 expression. We also demonstrate that neurons exposed to beta-amyloid increase HDAC2 and reduce histone H3 acetylation while HDAC2 knockdown prevents Abeta induced loss of histone H3 acetylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, caspase-3 activation, and neuronal death. The protective effect of HDAC2 knockdown was abrogated by Endo-B1 shRNA and in Endo-B1-null neurons, suggesting that HDAC2-induced neurotoxicity is mediated through suppression of Endo-B1. HDAC2 overexpression also modulates neuronal expression of mitofusin2 (Mfn2) and mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), recapitulating the pattern of change observed in AD. HDAC2 knockout mice demonstrate reduced injury in the middle cerebral artery occlusion with reperfusion (MCAO/R) model of cerebral ischemia demonstrating enhanced neuronal survival, minimized loss of Endo-B1, and normalized expression of Mfn2. These findings support the hypothesis that HDAC2 represses Endo-B1, sensitizing neurons to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in stroke and AD.\",\n",

       " ['30134656|t|Self-Assembled Curcumin-Poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) Conjugates: Potent Nano-Inhibitors against Amyloid beta-Protein Fibrillogenesis and Cytotoxicity.',\n",
       "  \"30134656|a|Fibrillogenesis of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, so inhibition of Abeta aggregation is considered as an important strategy for the precaution and treatment of AD. Curcumin (Cur) has been recognized as an effective inhibitor of Abeta fibrillogenesis, but its potential application is limited by its poor bioavailability. Herein, we proposed to conjugate Cur to a zwitterionic polymer, poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) (pCB), and synthesized three Cur@pCB conjugates of different degrees of substitution (DS, 1.9-2.9). Cur@pCB conjugates self-assembled into nanogels of 120-190 nm. The inhibition effects of Cur@pCB conjugates on the fibrillation and cytotoxicity of Abeta42 was investigated by extensive biophysical and biological analyses. Thioflavin T fluorescence assays and atomic force microscopic observations revealed that the Cur@pCB conjugates were much more efficient than molecular curcumin on inhibiting Abeta42 fibrillation, and cytotoxicity assays also indicated the same tendency. Of the three conjugates, Cur1@pCB of the lowest DS (1.97) exhibited the best performance; 5 muM Cur1@pCB functioned similarly with 25 muM free curcumin. Moreover, 5 muM Cur1@pCB increased the cell viability by 43% but free curcumin at the same concentration showed little effect. It is considered that the highly hydrated state of the zwitterionic polymers resulted in the superiority of Cur@pCB over free curcumin. Namely, the dense hydration layer on the conjugates strongly stabilized the bound Abeta on curcumin anchored on the polymer, suppressing the conformational transition of the protein to beta-sheet-rich structures. This was demonstrated by circular dichroism spectroscopy, in which Cur1@pCB was proven to be the strongest in the three conjugates. The research has thus revealed a new function of zwitterionic polymer pCBMA and provided new insights into the development of more potent nanoinhibitors for suppressing Abeta fibrillogenesis and cytotoxicity.\",\n",

Moreover, in APP23 mice, APP was found to accumulate intracellularly and its content was inversely correlated with the absolute spine density and the relative number of mushroom spines. Collectively, our results suggest that different pathological mechanisms, namely an intracellular accumulation of APP or extracellular amyloid plaques, may lead to spine abnormalities in young adult APP23 and deltaE9 mice, respectively.

       " 'abstract': \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to be caused by accumulation of amyloid-beta protein (A beta), which is a cleavage product of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Transgenic mice overexpressing APP have been used to recapitulate amyloid-beta pathology. Among them, APP23 and APPswe/PS1deltaE9 (deltaE9) mice are extensively studied. APP23 mice express APP with Swedish mutation and develop amyloid plaques late in their life, while cognitive deficits are observed in young age. In contrast, deltaE9 mice with mutant APP and mutant presenilin-1 develop amyloid plaques early but show typical cognitive deficits in old age. To unveil the reasons for different progressions of cognitive decline in these commonly used mouse models, we analyzed the number and turnover of dendritic spines as important structural correlates for learning and memory. Chronic in vivo two-photon imaging in apical tufts of layer V pyramidal neurons revealed a decreased spine density in 4-5-month-old APP23 mice. In age-matched deltaE9 mice, in contrast, spine loss was only observed on cortical dendrites that were in close proximity to amyloid plaques. In both cases, the reduced spine density was caused by decreased spine formation. Interestingly, the patterns of alterations in spine morphology differed between these two transgenic mouse models. Moreover, in APP23 mice, APP was found to accumulate intracellularly and its content was inversely correlated with the absolute spine density and the relative number of mushroom spines. Collectively, our results suggest that different pathological mechanisms, namely an intracellular accumulation of APP or extracellular amyloid plaques, may lead to spine abnormalities in young adult APP23 and deltaE9 mice, respectively. These distinct features, which may represent very different mechanisms of synaptic failure in AD, have to be taken into consideration when translating results from animal studies to the human disease.\",\n",
