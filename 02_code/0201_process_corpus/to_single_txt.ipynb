       " \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by neurological dysfunction, including memory impairment, attributed to the accumulation of amyloid beta (A beta) in the brain. Although several studies reported possible mechanisms involved in A beta pathology, much remains unknown. Previous findings suggested that a protein regulated in development and DNA damage response 1 (REDD1), a stress-coping regulator, is an A beta-responsive gene involved in A beta cytotoxicity. However, we still do not know how A beta increases the level of REDD1 and whether REDD1 mediates A beta-induced synaptic dysfunction. To elucidate this, we examined the effect of A beta on REDD1-expression using acute hippocampal slices from mice, and the effect of REDD1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) on A beta-induced synaptic dysfunction. Lastly, we observed the effect of REDD1 shRNA on memory deficit in an AD-like mouse model. Through the experiments, we found that A beta-incubated acute hippocampal slices showed increased REDD1 levels. Moreover, A beta injection into the lateral ventricle increased REDD1 levels in the hippocampus. Anisomycin, but not actinomycin D, blocked A beta-induced increase in REDD1 levels in the acute hippocampal slices, suggesting that A beta may increase REDD1 translation rather than transcription. A beta activated Fyn/ERK/S6 cascade, and inhibitors for Fyn/ERK/S6 or mGluR5 blocked A beta-induced REDD1 upregulation. REDD1 inducer, a transcriptional activator, and A beta blocked synaptic plasticity in the acute hippocampal slices. REDD1 inducer inhibited mTOR/Akt signaling. REDD1 shRNA blocked A beta-induced synaptic deficits. REDD1 shRNA also blocked A beta-induced memory deficits in passive-avoidance and object-recognition tests. Collectively, these results demonstrate that REDD1 participates in A beta pathology and could be a target for AD therapy.\",\n",

       " \"Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), a natural product derived from Radix Astragali (Astragalus membranaceus), is beneficial for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanisms underlying this benefit are not completely understood. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are potential therapeutic targets for AD. In this study, we found that amyloid beta protein fragment 1-42 oligomers (A beta O) suppressed BDNF and PPAR gamma expression, and inhibited tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) phosphorylation in cultured hippocampal neurons; these changes were ameliorated by treatment with AS-IV. Inhibition of PPAR gamma by genetic and pharmacological methods also blocked the effect of AS-IV on BDNF expression in A beta O-treated cells. Importantly, exogenous BDNF protected against neurotoxicity and apoptosis induced by A beta O, whereas inhibition of PPAR gamma reversed protective effects of AS-IV against these outcomes. In vivo data further revealed that AS-IV improved A beta O-induced memory impairment and reduced apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. Moreover, AS-IV suppressed the A beta O-induced reduction in BDNF by promoting PPAR gamma activation in the hippocampus. Taken together, these results indicate that AS-IV prevents A beta O-induced memory impairment and hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, probably by promoting the PPAR gamma/BDNF signaling pathway.\",\n",

YKL-40, a glycoprotein highly expressed in differentiated glial cells, is a candidate biomarker for in vivo tracking neuroinflammation in humans. We performed a longitudinal study in a monocentric cohort of cognitively healthy individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease exploring whether age, sex, and the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele affect plasma YKL-40 concentrations. We investigated whether YKL-40 is associated with brain amyloid-beta (A beta) deposition, neuronal activity, and neurodegeneration as assessed via neuroimaging biomarkers. Finally, we investigated whether YKL-40 may predict cognitive performance. We found an age-associated increase of YKL-40 and observed that men display higher concentrations than women, indicating a potential sexual dimorphism. Moreover, YKL-40 was positively associated with memory performance and negatively associated with brain A beta deposition (but not with metabolic signal).

Here, we examined the mutation effect inSGLT2on brain function and longevity. No differences were found in the survival curve, depression-like behavior, and age-related brain atrophy between SAMP10-Delta Sglt2 and SAMP10(+). However, memory retention was lower in SAMP10-Delta Sglt2 mice than SAMP10(+). Amyloid beta (A4) precursor-like protein 1 (Aplp1) expression was significantly lower in the hippocampus of SAMP10-Delta SGLT2 than in SAMP10(+) at 2 months of age, but was similar at 12 months of age. CaM kinase-like vesicle association (Camkv) expression was remarkably lower in SAMP10(+). These genes have been reported to be involved in dendrite function. Amyloid precursor proteins have been reported to involve in maintaining homeostasis of glucose and insulin.

The spatial learning and memory ability of mice were examined by using the Morris water maze. Thioflavin S staining was used to observe A beta deposition. ELISA was used to evaluate the levels of A beta(40) and A beta(42). The expression levels of mitophagy proteins (PINK1, Parkin, LC3-II and LC3-I) and amyloidogenic APP processing proteins (BACE1, APP and CTF beta) were examined by western blotting analysis. Finally, transmission electron microscopy was used to observe mitochondrial structure and mitophagy vesicles. Our results showed that APP/PS1 transgenic mice with long-term oral melatonin showed improved spatial learning, alleviated memory impairment, reduced A beta deposition and restrained damage of mitochondrial structure. In addition, the number of mitophagy vesicles and expression levels of mitophagy factors (PINK1, Parkin, LC3-II/LC3-I) were decreased, as was the expression levels of amyloidogenic APP processing proteins (BACE1, APP and CTF beta).

       " \"Background: Studies of elderly subjects using biomarkers that are proxies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology have the potential to document meaningful relationships between cognitive performance and biomarker changes along the AD continuum. Objective: To document cognitive performance differences across distinct AD stages using a categorization based on the presence of PET-assessed amyloid-beta (A beta) burden and neurodegeneration. Methods: Patients with mild dementia compatible with AD (n = 38) or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI; n = 43) and a cognitively unimpaired group (n = 27) underwent PET with Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB) assessing A beta aggregation (A+) and [F-18]FDG-PET assessing neurodegeneration ((N)+). Cognitive performance was assessed with verbal and visual episodic memory tests and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Results: The A+(N)+ subgroup (n = 32) showed decreased (p < 0.001) cognitive test scores compared to both A+(N)-(n = 18) and A-(N)- (n = 49) subjects, who presented highly similar mean cognitive scores. Despite its modest size (n = 9), the A-(N)+ subgroup showed lower (p < 0.043) verbal memory scores relative to A-(N)- subjects, and trend lower (p = 0.096) scores relative to A+(N)- subjects. Continuous A beta measures (standard uptake value ratios of PiB uptake) were correlated most significantly with visual memory scores both in the overall sample and when analyses were restricted to dementia or (N)+ subjects, but not in non-dementia or (N)- groups. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that significant A beta-cognition relationships are highly salient at disease stages involving neurodegeneration. The fact that findings relating A beta burden to memory performance were detected only at (N)+ stages, together with the similarity of test scores between A+(N)- and A-(N)- subjects, reinforce the view that A beta-cognition relationships during early AD stages may remain undetectable unless substantially large samples are evaluated.\",\n",

Our findings illustrate the continuum of PM2.5 neurotoxicity that contributes to early decline of immediate free recall/new learning at the preclinical stage, which is mediated by progressive atrophy of grey matter indicative of increased Alzheimer's disease risk, independent of cerebrovascular damage.\"],\n",

       "  \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by neurological dysfunction, including memory impairment, attributed to the accumulation of amyloid beta (A beta) in the brain. Although several studies reported possible mechanisms involved in A beta pathology, much remains unknown. Previous findings suggested that a protein regulated in development and DNA damage response 1 (REDD1), a stress-coping regulator, is an A beta-responsive gene involved in A beta cytotoxicity. However, we still do not know how A beta increases the level of REDD1 and whether REDD1 mediates A beta-induced synaptic dysfunction. To elucidate this, we examined the effect of A beta on REDD1-expression using acute hippocampal slices from mice, and the effect of REDD1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) on A beta-induced synaptic dysfunction. Lastly, we observed the effect of REDD1 shRNA on memory deficit in an AD-like mouse model. Through the experiments, we found that A beta-incubated acute hippocampal slices showed increased REDD1 levels. Moreover, A beta injection into the lateral ventricle increased REDD1 levels in the hippocampus. Anisomycin, but not actinomycin D, blocked A beta-induced increase in REDD1 levels in the acute hippocampal slices, suggesting that A beta may increase REDD1 translation rather than transcription. A beta activated Fyn/ERK/S6 cascade, and inhibitors for Fyn/ERK/S6 or mGluR5 blocked A beta-induced REDD1 upregulation. REDD1 inducer, a transcriptional activator, and A beta blocked synaptic plasticity in the acute hippocampal slices. REDD1 inducer inhibited mTOR/Akt signaling. REDD1 shRNA blocked A beta-induced synaptic deficits. REDD1 shRNA also blocked A beta-induced memory deficits in passive-avoidance and object-recognition tests. Collectively, these results demonstrate that REDD1 participates in A beta pathology and could be a target for AD therapy.\"],\n",

       "  \"Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), a natural product derived from Radix Astragali (Astragalus membranaceus), is beneficial for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanisms underlying this benefit are not completely understood. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are potential therapeutic targets for AD. In this study, we found that amyloid beta protein fragment 1-42 oligomers (A beta O) suppressed BDNF and PPAR gamma expression, and inhibited tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) phosphorylation in cultured hippocampal neurons; these changes were ameliorated by treatment with AS-IV. Inhibition of PPAR gamma by genetic and pharmacological methods also blocked the effect of AS-IV on BDNF expression in A beta O-treated cells. Importantly, exogenous BDNF protected against neurotoxicity and apoptosis induced by A beta O, whereas inhibition of PPAR gamma reversed protective effects of AS-IV against these outcomes. In vivo data further revealed that AS-IV improved A beta O-induced memory impairment and reduced apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. Moreover, AS-IV suppressed the A beta O-induced reduction in BDNF by promoting PPAR gamma activation in the hippocampus. Taken together, these results indicate that AS-IV prevents A beta O-induced memory impairment and hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, probably by promoting the PPAR gamma/BDNF signaling pathway.\"],\n",

       "  \"Neuroinflammation, a key early pathomechanistic alteration of Alzheimer's disease, may represent either a detrimental or a compensatory mechanism or both (according to the disease stage). YKL-40, a glycoprotein highly expressed in differentiated glial cells, is a candidate biomarker for in vivo tracking neuroinflammation in humans. We performed a longitudinal study in a monocentric cohort of cognitively healthy individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease exploring whether age, sex, and the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele affect plasma YKL-40 concentrations. We investigated whether YKL-40 is associated with brain amyloid-beta (A beta) deposition, neuronal activity, and neurodegeneration as assessed via neuroimaging biomarkers. Finally, we investigated whether YKL-40 may predict cognitive performance. We found an age-associated increase of YKL-40 and observed that men display higher concentrations than women, indicating a potential sexual dimorphism. Moreover, YKL-40 was positively associated with memory performance and negatively associated with brain A beta deposition (but not with metabolic signal). Consistent with translational studies, our results suggest a potentially protective effect of glia on incipient brain A beta accumulation and neuronal homeostasis. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

A line of SAMP10 with spontaneous mutation in theSlc5a2gene encoding the sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 was named SAMP10/TaSlc-Slc5a2(slc)(SAMP10-Delta Sglt2) and was identified as a renal diabetes model. In contrast, a line of SAMP10 with no mutation in SGLT2 (SAMP10/TaIdrSlc, SAMP10(+)) was recently established under a specific pathogen-free condition. Here, we examined the mutation effect inSGLT2on brain function and longevity. No differences were found in the survival curve, depression-like behavior, and age-related brain atrophy between SAMP10-Delta Sglt2 and SAMP10(+). However, memory retention was lower in SAMP10-Delta Sglt2 mice than SAMP10(+). Amyloid beta (A4) precursor-like protein 1 (Aplp1) expression was significantly lower in the hippocampus of SAMP10-Delta SGLT2 than in SAMP10(+) at 2 months of age, but was similar at 12 months of age. CaM kinase-like vesicle association (Camkv) expression was remarkably lower in SAMP10(+). These genes have been reported to be involved in dendrite function. Amyloid precursor proteins have been reported to involve in maintaining homeostasis of glucose and insulin. These results suggest that mutation inSGLT2results in down-regulation ofAplp1in young age, which can lead to poor memory retention in old age.'],\n",

The spatial learning and memory ability of mice were examined by using the Morris water maze. Thioflavin S staining was used to observe A beta deposition. ELISA was used to evaluate the levels of A beta(40) and A beta(42). The expression levels of mitophagy proteins (PINK1, Parkin, LC3-II and LC3-I) and amyloidogenic APP processing proteins (BACE1, APP and CTF beta) were examined by western blotting analysis. Finally, transmission electron microscopy was used to observe mitochondrial structure and mitophagy vesicles. Our results showed that APP/PS1 transgenic mice with long-term oral melatonin showed improved spatial learning, alleviated memory impairment, reduced A beta deposition and restrained damage of mitochondrial structure. In addition, the number of mitophagy vesicles and expression levels of mitophagy factors (PINK1, Parkin, LC3-II/LC3-I) were decreased, as was the expression levels of amyloidogenic APP processing proteins (BACE1, APP and CTF beta).

       "  \"Background: Studies of elderly subjects using biomarkers that are proxies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology have the potential to document meaningful relationships between cognitive performance and biomarker changes along the AD continuum. Objective: To document cognitive performance differences across distinct AD stages using a categorization based on the presence of PET-assessed amyloid-beta (A beta) burden and neurodegeneration. Methods: Patients with mild dementia compatible with AD (n = 38) or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI; n = 43) and a cognitively unimpaired group (n = 27) underwent PET with Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB) assessing A beta aggregation (A+) and [F-18]FDG-PET assessing neurodegeneration ((N)+). Cognitive performance was assessed with verbal and visual episodic memory tests and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Results: The A+(N)+ subgroup (n = 32) showed decreased (p < 0.001) cognitive test scores compared to both A+(N)-(n = 18) and A-(N)- (n = 49) subjects, who presented highly similar mean cognitive scores. Despite its modest size (n = 9), the A-(N)+ subgroup showed lower (p < 0.043) verbal memory scores relative to A-(N)- subjects, and trend lower (p = 0.096) scores relative to A+(N)- subjects. Continuous A beta measures (standard uptake value ratios of PiB uptake) were correlated most significantly with visual memory scores both in the overall sample and when analyses were restricted to dementia or (N)+ subjects, but not in non-dementia or (N)- groups. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that significant A beta-cognition relationships are highly salient at disease stages involving neurodegeneration. The fact that findings relating A beta burden to memory performance were detected only at (N)+ stages, together with the similarity of test scores between A+(N)- and A-(N)- subjects, reinforce the view that A beta-cognition relationships during early AD stages may remain undetectable unless substantially large samples are evaluated.\"]]"

In the present study, we tested whether pinoresinol reduces learning and memory and excitatory synaptic deficits in an amyloid beta (A beta)-induced AD-like mouse model. Pinoresinol enhanced hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) through calcium-permeable AMPA receptor, which was mediated by Akt activation. Moreover, pinoresinol ameliorated LTP deficits in amyloid beta (A beta)treated hippocampal slices via Akt signaling. Oral administration of pinoresinol ameliorated A beta-induced memory deficits without sensory dysfunction. Moreover, AD-like pathology, including neuroinflammation and synaptic deficit, were ameliorated by pinoresinol administration.

Neuronal protein synthesis is essential for long-term memory consolidation, and its dysregulation is implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cellular stress triggers the activation of protein kinases that converge on the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), which attenuates mRNA translation. This translational inhibition is one aspect of the integrated stress response (ISR). We found that postmortem brain tissue from AD patients showed increased phosphorylation of eIF2α and reduced abundance of eIF2B, another key component of the translation initiation complex. Systemic administration of the small-molecule compound ISRIB (which blocks the ISR downstream of phosphorylated eIF2α) rescued protein synthesis in the hippocampus, measures of synaptic plasticity, and performance on memory-associated behavior tests in wild-type mice cotreated with salubrinal (which inhibits translation by inducing eIF2α phosphorylation) and in both β-amyloid-treated and transgenic AD model mice. Thus, attenuating the ISR downstream of phosphorylated eIF2α may restore hippocampal protein synthesis and delay cognitive decline in AD patients.\n"
